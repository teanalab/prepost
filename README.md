All experiments were performed on a collection of auto reviews, which is included here with the used dictionary.

1) [goldstandard.txt](https://github.com/teanalab/prepost/blob/master/goldstandard.txt) [prepurchase and postpurchase reviews are annotated by 1 and 2 respectively]

2) [dictionary.txt](https://github.com/teanalab/prepost/blob/master/dictionary.txt) [to expand the seed words, we utilized online thesaurus  with their synonyms and considered each resulting set of words as a dictionary]
