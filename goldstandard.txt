label	review
2 owned a 2008 gmc acadia and it was a total lemon but we loved the design space and the look we decided to give a 2014 a try
2 so far we are very pleased
1 looked at dodge & ford thought the gm would be a better vehicle for my use but i am left wanting a better truck for what i had to pay for it
1 i've test drove all the trucks out there
2 by far my favorite truck i have owned or tested
1 it has great towing capacity and fuel economy
1 would not buy this i would stick to the ford f-150
2 very happy with this truck
1 found exactly the truck i was looking for
2 would not buy again
2 give it a 10 for great improvements over previous gmc 1500's that i have had
2 so far this is everything i have come to expect from a truck 
2 even in the coldest of weather  multiple days below zero   the interior fit and quality hold true the fuel mileage is better than the ford as well as the interior egromics 
1 the 62 liter v8 is a monster
2 have had no problems at all since i purchased the truck
2 buyers remorse this truck has major electrical issues
1 buying one on friday after testing and driving all the copetitors this truck excels on test drives
1 this truck is !
1 fit and finnish is unbelievable and this thing is !
1 far from the tinker trucks like !
1 this is americas truck for !
2 owned for 22 days been able to drive it 10 of those day because it is in the dealership for repairs
2 can not drive to far from home in case it breaks down waiting for back ordered parts
2 i traded 2011 ram wish i bought a ram or a ford
1 i am not impressed
2 i would buy another
2 the best truck i have ever owned
2 i will buy another
2 i like the gmc very well and my wife feels real comfortable driving it
1 we have looked at ford and dodge and they have some really good features
2 best vehicle i've ever owned safe and powerful
2 would not buy again i compromised on the power hoping for the better mpg well it delivered on the lack of horsepower but came up short on epa mpg ratings i get about 20 combined mpg and have never topped 25 mpg on a complete highway trip after now
2 traded in a 2010 mazda cx 7 and like this suv better more room quietier & smoother ride
1 the 2013 gmc terrain based upon admittedly short experience has proven to be excellent
2 it is a good value at the price--i received 0% financing and a $500 rebate
1 overall i would reccommend that if one is interested in this vehicle don't even look at the small engine you will waste your money
2 i had this vehicle since feb 12 and just traded it in for a gmc sierra 1500
2 i researched this vehicle for 2 years before buying the 2012 slt v4
1 i was looking for something more fuel efficient and stylish than my 2008 trailblazer
1 the terrain is a perfect fit and i average 25mpg
1 i would have to rate it up there with any of the best
1 the only other one i think might be better or perhaps just a bit bigger is the cadilac suv or crossover
1 but being as money doesn't grow on trees here in wisconsin i guess i will just be happy wit
2 one of the best and most appreciated new vehicle i have ever owned and driven
2 i went from a nissan pathfinder of 10 years to a gmc terrainhuge change but i got tired of the getting gas twice a week and i needed something smaller and new
1 i was never a fan of american cars but i did say that if i were to get one it would be a gm
2 very pleased with the purchase of this vehicle
1 i love it - so pretty and not !
1 near luxuryno question
1 really like this vehicle if they could just figure out what is wrong with the collision alert system
1 it really is a beautiful car and rides beautiful
1 i figure that it is a trade offif you want good gas mileage buy a compact or a hybrid
1 if you want something more comfortable but lower gas mileage the terrain fits the bill
1 it reminds me of the classic station-wagon a sadly defunct class of cars that were a good compromise between a sedan and a vandon't expect sports sedan handling or acce
2 i won't buy another one
2 i will go back to being a jeep owner
1 i can endure for another yearbut will switch
1 it's a terrific package especially styling and !
1 i'll have to just accept that in this eco-nuts era i'm just not going to get the earth-splitting torque of yesteryear
1 i'm not a huge fan of compromise in anything but the terrain is a convinc
1 probably should have purchased a ford edge
2 our daughrter bought this for a mom van trading an 8 cylinder truck
2 she likes the terrain and it suits her needs now but no power
2 i am pleased with my decision to purchase the gmc versus the audi a4
1 this is an exelent vehical for the money
1 get the v6 and you can't go wrong
1 i think this car is the next aztec
1 can't see gas gage because of steering wheel
1 drink holders in front rubber lined hole watch trying to pull it
2 i like it and would buy another one
2 we looked at ford escape honda crv chevy equinox and other small/midsize suv's and none compared to what you get with the gmc terrain
1 this one looks like a !
2 love the vehicle and i have the 4 cyl awd in wisconsin
1 cannot kick on the power or the performance
2 traded my envoy for this vehicle just for the gas mileage and for the noise reduction on the highway
2 i have 6 cy front wheel drive and i love my little car
2 previously i had a suburban and was just tired herding it around town and parking
1 i love the size and performance of the terrain
1 test drive the other vehicles in this class just so your mind is at ease when you decide to purchase the !
1 didn't drive the hyundai or kia so maybe take a look at those just in case
1 the cr-v was easily the most uncomfortable veh
1 just don't go overboard on the gizmos
2 i get a combined 27 mpg if i watch my driving style lay into it and it goes way down
2 best vehicle ever owned
1 great ride everything in a small suv with 6 cy for all the power and speeds for california traffic
1 will never recommend to anyone
1 didn't realize gmc had such inferior product
1 this is an exceptional small suv
2 it has plenty of power gets decent gas mileage and is very comfortable
2 until i found this i thoguht i'd have to spend the day inside
1 i would to see a litte more hp gmc you did a good job onm this truck and how to use it
1 however i think gmc needs to add the guidelines with the rear back up camera
1 most vehicles have this feature when they have the backup camera for the vehicle
1 i would think this would be an added safety feature of the veh
1 i hope the makers consider correcting the problems i mentioned above
2 if not i would not even consider purchasing this vehicle again
2 would buy again
2 we have always had a suv but my first gmc & love it
1 too expensive for the product
2 i love it and would buy it again
2 disappointed in terrain even though the suv has a lot to love
2 would buy again
2 excellent i would not think twice about buying one !
2 good vehicle but with the 3800 and it's power train it would be better and perhaps a 95
2 love the car but really miss the safety feature of automatic lights
1 gm missed the boat on this one and the dealership was not aware that this feature not available
2 dont get this car you will regret it it is very cheaply built
1 i would give it a 10
1 test drive this vehicle if you get the chance
1 the denali is a very nice suv to drive
1 it has many nice driving and passenger features and it is powerful
2 2013 awd denali xl - very comfortable ride powerful great handling great exterior styling all the creature comforts of your living room plus room for storage for the driver and passengers
1 with 3 dvd screens to watch a dvd movie front seat screen
2 looks and drives great just wish gas milage was as advertised
2 the best car i ever had
1 this is an awesome car
2 very pleased so far
1 that's a smart way of lokoing at the world
2 love it completely and rue the day when i get my first smack and run scratch/dent from a parking lot knucklehead
2 love it completely and rue the day when i get my first smack and run scratch/dent from a parking lot knucklehead
2 great car sport mode llove the economy of the car and the price is cheap for the quality and reliability microfiber seats are great
2 need more travel on the drivers sidecar should have heated side mirrors
2 i took more than one year to buy new car and in between i was going through numerous reviews test rides and friends experiences whoever bought any car brand in 1st week they were blown away but after some time you can see them back to reality
1 i just can't justify paying over $500 a month for a car payment doesn't make sense to methe last generation was lacking in several areas this generation is the best version to date
1 the double-wishbone suspension is gone in favor of a traditional macp
2 just got the car and have only have 150 miles on it
1 i think this is the ideal midsize choice
2 my first honda
2 honda ride quality lacks compares to other cars i owned but still a good car
1 the fit and finish is very improved over past models
1 braking is also very good
2 was considering some german models but frankly the honda reliability won me over
1 this honda accord is nothing short of !
2 the driving experience is so good that at times it seems surreal
1 quality simply oozes from every component used in the construction of this american made product
1 do some research on the grades of meta
2 unmatched in reliability and quality
2 nice car but i think i got a lemon
1 wow-wow-wow the 2014 accord ex-l v6 is incredible
2 great handling blue-tooth back-up camera leather wraped steering wheel189 hp
2 we've been buying honda's and acura's since the late 1980's and this is the best accord yet
2 this is my first new car and i absolutely love it
1 the style reminds me of a bmw
2 the stock rims are fantastic i have the black on black sport trim
1 the car is fire
1 the gas mileage is unbelievable for the amount of horsepower you get
2 it is just the best midsize car around for daily driving long term ownership value all that good stuff is here
1 overall i would give it a 95 out of 10
1 excellent reliable and technologically advanced transportation
2 came from a 350hp subaru and was concerned that the 185ph i4 engine would not be enough power for me
2 glad i got the i4 with a timing chain never change a $1000 timing belt 40-46mpg and power needed to get out of traffic in a hurry
2 i would tell people about my car
2 this car fits our needs like a glove yet is great lookingj sporty and fun to drive
2 i am 6'-2and am comfortable riding in the back - so with one seven year old son this car will meet our needs for a long time
1 and it is considerably less expensive t
1 the honda accord v6 sedan ex-l's or touring edition offers high-end luxury and performance at a great price
1 after looking at all the competition including acura the accord offered the best overall value
1 people know honda's reputation for reliability and it pays wen when it is time to trade cars
1 color selection is decent and its resale is very good
1 wonderful car for the size-just as nice if not nicer than its competitors
2 just purchased the 2013 honda civic lx auto and absolutely love it
1 after looking at its usual competitors i couldn't find another that had the looks handling refinement and value found in the civic
1 this car has improved !
2 i use it as a commuter car and i love it
1 purchase the top ex-l trim if possible
2 this vehicle is a great value and very fun to drive
1 with honda's reputation for quality and resale value you can't go wrong with the 2013 civic
2 i just went from a 2010 civic dx l to a 2013 civic lx and i have to confess that i am surprised by all the new standard additions made to these cars
1 the 2013 is physically more attractive in my opinion
1 car buyers should at least consider this car
1 after all they have the reputation of strong and efficient car
1 the prius gets 50 mpg in city - and comes with all the features of the civic exl except for the backup camera
2 however i chose style over economy
1 with all you get i think that this honda is the best value no matter how rich or poor you are
2 this is the first car i have ever owned that does not feel like i paid too much for it has everything i need and then some at the right price
1 the redesigned civics for 2013 are probably the best small cars on the market
1 even the base lx model is on par with what other small cars have on mid and upper trim levels
2 i just had this car for a week and i am happy i chose it over the prius c which i had also considered
1 i won't do much long distance driving so the difference in fuel cost will be marginal
1 visibility is great all around
1 great car for it's price and a proven platform
1 decent car but not the world leader it has been in the past
1 styling: i love the new styling which resembles the 2013 accord
1 the chrome adds elegance and sophistication
1 it is no longer the cheap looking econobox of the pastengine: 18 liter 4-cylinder with 140hp which means it has to work harder when passing an
2 very nice car for drive in the big city
1 2013 did major improvements from the 2012 model
1 great car for college students luxury features in a compact car
1 everything you need from a car
1 my review of the honda civic ex-l would be a 97 out of 100
1 this is a great every day car because of the gas efficiency its interior comfort and all the accessories necessary for every day life
2 i think the consumer reports score is way too lowit must be for the 2012 not the 2013 for the money not much out there to beat in with style  performance tech and mileage
2 the power is just right for its size and i am comfortable in the interior i don't feel cramped
1 i am leasing this car and frankly will be glad when my time is up so i can return it
1 the thing that bugs me the most is the highway experience
1 the car goes all over the place at highway speed and needs alot of correction
1 braking & handling are ok the acceleration is slow i can feel the street underneath me as if the car is low to the ground
1 buy it and relax and enjoy a great ride
2 i am very satisfied with my civic
1 i give it a ten all around
1 it looks modern and had plenty of cool standard features
2 i'm hooked on civics from now on
1 i think it would be a good reliable car but far from the best of its class
2 best car i ever owned
2 if it wasn't for the seats i'd give it a perfect 10
2 i had a 2008 civic that was wonderful
2 it drove flawlessly to 100k miles
2 i sold it and got a new one
2 i sure hope i can learn to like the !
1 best compact sedan in it's class
2 enjoy driving it
2 excellent auto very versatile and drives well
2 so far i'm completely satisfied
1 the acceleration tonal qualities of the v6 engine suspension handling etc
1 it's impressive looking and fun to drive
1 there isn't much honda could do to improve this vehicle
1 the improved rugged styling for
1 i give it a 9 out of 10
2 great cross over honda you've done it again !
1 great all-around !
1 one the subject of drivers size
2 the ct is one of a very small number of available new cars that had enough room to accommodate my rather bigger than the average bearsize
2 it sits just high enough off the ground that it does not hurt my knees gettin
2 we really like our 2013 ct
2 it is well made comfortable driving especially on long road trips we get a number of people noticing the vehicle and make favorable comments
1 it's a shame this vehicle is such a secret for the general public
2 fun car to drive and very !
2 mine is 3+ years !
2 have not felt this way about a car since my very first one
2 love driving this !
1 wonder why the acura zdx is such a failure price but 
1 too bad they lose
1 cars i've had that are up there: 944 turbo legend coupe q-45 94 corvette
2 this is the best overall car i've ever owned and i've owned lexus and mazda in the past
1 overall stylishness and function is not to be found anywhere else
2 handles great in new england weather and on dry pavement
2 very comfortable smooth ride
2 i traded in a lexus gs300 for the crosstour mostly because i need more cargo room
2 i didn't want a full size suv since i like the characteristics of a sporty sedan
1 the crosstour gives me the combination of both
2 plus i did not lose any of the luxury f
1 should have power liftgate
2 it has the reliabilty of a honda saftey factors a plus comfortable smooth pleasure to drive easy access getting in and out doesnt feel like a truck or a bumpy sports car feels like a magical cross drives like a car the rear window u
1 the blind spots take time to get used to
2 my overall review is that this is an excellent automobile and would recommend it to anyone looking for a stylish all-around auto
2 handles well the v6 has enough power to get up to highway speed from ramps and into the flow of higher speed traffic
1 good fit and finish
1 great for golf equipment
1 looking forward to many years with my !
2 this vehicle is reliable and meets all my needs
1 do not hesitate on this suv
2 i tested all popular models and this one won out
2 this is the second honda cr-v we have owned
1 the awd gets around 3mpg less around town than the front wheel
1 if you are looking for value comfort safety reliability resale value and good performance then the honda cr-v deserves a serious look
2 i droved comfortable sport cars and coupes prior to buying this crv so it is very uncomortable to sit upright
1 however it is a quality built and reliable reasonable priced vehicle
2 having issues with the tire pressure warning light
2 it has come on 5 times it about two months back to the dealer 3 times no solution
2 honda america will inform me when a computer fix can be done
2 very unhappy driving with the light on review i
1 looking forward to getting 250000 outa this one
1 however when one adds trim and options it gets pricey
2 good for use around town but don't take it on a trip unless you want a back ache and ringing in your ears
2 very stylisheasy to drive
2 we were concerned that switching from our honda accord ex-v6 to the honda cr-v would cost us more to operate
2 but we were pleasantly surprised that our cr-v actually gets better mileage than our accord
1 needs side warning lights on mirrors
2 i love driving !
1 the price was great the gas mileage is better than most
1 great job !
2 this is my 5th honda after 3 civics and a pilot ex-l awd
1 i did prefer the pilot but not the 17-18 mpg
1 i am getting 25+ mpg in the cr-v in a blend of stop-and-go and highway driving which is good for an awd vehicle
1 haven't had a chance to really test
2 is excellent for running around town and short trips down the interstate
1 is not a high end ride but very well equipped
2 had the cr-v for 1 month and found no flaws yet
1 construction quality is very good
1 headlights are dangerously terrible
2 this is my 4th generation of cr-v and it's getting better everytime honda redesigns it
1 good job !
2 love it will buy another
1 in eco mode i'm getting 31 mpg overall
2 i'm a bachelor so the two seats are fine with me; but may not be for others
2 it's great to drive
2 handles great on wet roads
2 i'm so happy i bought the crz in february
2 it's one amazing looking car that's oh-so-fun to drive
2 as a lone commuter like almost everyone else on the road the two-seater crz has been perfect for me
2 after 6000 miles the fuel economy remains much better
1 9 out of 10
2 this is my first suv and i love !
1 honda truly made a vehicle in its own category: it's like a jeep a truck and a van all in one
1 the element is perfect for my active lifestyle
2 it is easy to park and has a small turning radius
2 i don't have to twist my back up for access
1 i love the design
1 it will last many years as honda's do
2 it's a really great practical auto if you own you will see
2 i bought this new at the end of january 2011
1 it has honda engineering
2 it feels safe but it does have a high profileoverall a good buy
1 they evidently last a long time as well
1 if you take a serious look at the way you drive and you find that your real needs are multi purpose functional and reliabilty then the element should be considered
1 you can add a few creature comforts along the way as most do with their cars
2 people have frequently asked me how i like my car and i probably bore them to tears extolling the virtues of the honda element
2 i have put very little money into this car other than the normal wear and tear type things
2 spent only about $1000 in 9 years and 178000 miles since 2003
1 a great vehicle for carrying anything from a tv to dogs
2 this is a car that i would buy again but probably won't have to because of honda's record of durabilaty
2 a car i would recommend highly lot's of interior spacegood mpg attractive design in the sport packagecar is a lot of fun to drive and has all the features i needed for a commuter car and it's peace of mind because it's a honda
2 i've owned only honda cars for 35 years
2 wouldn't even consider buying anything else
2 i love my new honda fit
1 all in all good car for in town driving
1 the fit is a great car that has many thoughtful design features honda's engineers did a great !
2 nice car fun to drive great gas mileage with 5 speed manual
2 great oil change and schedule services at honda dealer for saving time and less stress
1 it has more personality and is sportier
2 we love our little fit
1 compared to other cars we drove this one sits higher and you feel like you are in a larger car
2 great car will have it forever and when the motor goes out you can put in a bigger honda motor
1 i have to tape up the interior of my car
1 cant afford to repair it too expensive
1 a cover in the truck would be very good
1 fantastic car by great manufacturer
2 when i bought the fiet i never imagined the real worth of this vehicle people want to buy from me
1 mileage and i have proof 36- 45 miles per gallon
2 oh i own a 2011 model awsome little car immings
2 did i say i love my ?
1 solid reliable high mpg car
2 should not pass up this car  worth the money and then some
1 this is a wonderful car and if you are in the market for a hybrid commuter car you must test drive it
1 there is more out there than the prius
2 good purchase and like the great mileage with a great ride
2 overall i'm very happy with the honda
1 honda quality innovation and ingenuity is there
2 it's safe and feels stable in adverse conditions
1 lets face itthis truck doesn't exactly win beauty contests
1 but what it lacks in looks it more than makes up for in personality and quality
1 i wish that honda would update the inside with automatic head lights and more up to date controls on the dash
2 i would recommend this truck to everyone i know because of the smooth ride and storage
1 maybe they could work on the mileage too with a differe
1 if you are looking for a truck and you do not need a huge bed look at the ridgeline
2 my truck fits my needs like a glove
2 my truck goes through snow like a knife through hot butter
2 love it i have owned 2 of them and will buy a third
1 nice going into the dealership and not having high pressure sales
1 salesman at martin honda  bruce said this is what i have and here is the price
1 also if you're going to trade in your vehicle go on line and check itf
1 there is much more to like than dislike
2 it is a very handy truck for a person who occasionally hauls and tows but likes the feel and riding position of a truck
2 it isn't so big you can't park it but not so small you can't haul anything
2 so far no issues with the truck
1 added front & rear honda splashguards prior to delivery
2 first time i owned a 2008
2 it was not prep well but i think it was more that the dealer wanted to dump this unit since it had been sitting on their lot for 11 months
1 keep up maintances and itll be a great truck for years
2 dealer gave me a great deal on my tradein
2 longevity will be the best determination of what i sum up this car to be but with the warranty it shouldn't be an issue
1 hyundai has changed the game with this machine
1 now it's time for them to change the symbol and grab the youth/midrange age market
1 we are the furture and hyundai can be the leader in this lucrative market
1 so what's it going to be ?
2 overall we are very satisfied with the azera and would probably buy it again
1 the car has beautiful lines and style
1 nice job hyundai
1 you won't regret buying an azera if this is the car you like
2 really happy with choice
1 won't see your self coming and going they are unique and standout
2 really didn't want $4k primer package - big hot sunroof hard 19tires and few other toys
1 the base 450 watt stereo is great and includes subwoofer
2 would buy again
2 better than the lexus es i traded in and $10000 cheaper than a new lexus esincredibly spacious
2 i am 6'2tall and never have to move my seat up to make room for passengers in the backcan't imagine why hyundai doesn't do anything
2 i thought my sonata was a great car but the azera goes way beyond it in offering a quiet luxurious ride; beautiful head-turning styling; and an incredible array of tech gadgets and gizmos that i marvel at every time i use them
1 yes it's around $10k m
2 this is my third azera from 2008 to 2010 until now a 2012
2 i am so impressed with this car that i bragged about it at the 2013 philly auto show also there is not enough room given here to go into detail about my satisfying experience with azera
1 the car is little more pricey than before but it is still a best buy for the money and compares very favorably with lexus mb and audi for much less $
1 finally a v6 that gets just about 30 mpg
1 blue link is amazing
1 better than lexus 350 by a wide margin
1 great car for the money we were used to spending 60 to $70k for her car
1 this car has more equipment handles better at much lower price tag
1 gets a lot of thumbs up from other drivers
1 always finding nice
1 a pleasure to drive
2 my second azera  have a 2007no problems after 75k hope this 2013 gives me the same reliability
1 nav heated front & rear seats leather and everything a person could want at a great !
2 the value to me was with all of the options this car is less money than all of the competitors wi
2 hands down best car i have ever owned
1 i am from detroit and know what a car should be
1 oh by the way consumer reports stick to what you know- dishwashers
1 the azera is full sized stylish car that is quiet smooth ridding and very comfortable; whether it's short trips around town or on an extended road trip
2 i compare my azera to my previously owned lin
2 i love my new car
1 hyundai is building solid reliable quality cars
2 i love this car once we test drove it i had to have it
2 got a great deal and for all the bells and whistles on this car the avalon would have cost well over $40000
2 great car for the cost looking at purchasing a second one
2 getting almost 30mph on hiway quiet smooth ride very stylish
2 i have owned many cars in the last 40 years but this is the best automobile ever
2 i had to put it in the garage as it is so fun to drive
1 many people see it out and about and want to know what it is as the azera is not seen on the road very much
1 handles a little like a sports sedan
1 then again i ain't your normal grandfather
1 almost everything comes standard
2 the accent has come a long way over the last 5 years and i would rececommend this car to anyone looking for a car in this price range
1 you would think if you went down to this size car the fuel mileage would have been worth it
1 i would consider now a diesel or a hybrid
1 this review is to counter the ridiculously biased review of dennis in south carolina on 08/04/2012 who sounds like an angry 9 year old child - and has no clue what he is talking about
1 great design  plenty of room inside especially back seat compared to elantra and sonatahigher roofline means better headroom higher sitting off ground means easier to get into/out ofignore the review from the guy who doesn't even own !
1 don't do it until someone shows you that hyundai can reach 500000 miles like my previous 97 civic did and overall hyundai copys honda and toyota and lexus and acura
1 when you unlock a hyundai the unlock chime belongs to toyota
2 it's everything i expected
2 i bought the russian version called hyundai solaris because it's not sold in other european countries
1 it's an automatic hatch with 5 doors
1 it's very well-tailored for the harsh conditions of the russian roads
1 come on hyundai bring this fantastic
1 great car for a great price
1 anyone looking for safe reliable car thats below 14500
1 overall i would say hyundai is fast becoming the auto of choice based on how many i see now and the reviews the company is receiving
2 after a couple years i'd like to revisit this review and see what i have to day then
1 right now it's a no-brainer
2 i travel mostly highway miles a commuter car so its puuurfect for me; and after a two and half months of ownership who needs a elantra or a ?
2 the car has a bulletproof engine and transmission somewhat basic suspention could be a little stiffer but steering is nice and tight needs a little practice to get it to go straight this car has the capability to last a very long time you just need to
1 overall i'd rate it a 9
2 i have had my 2012 accent since july 2011 no problems and it rides wellin the winter traction is sometimes a problem but usually when other cars also have the same problems
1 don't hesitate to drop in on your hyundai dealer
1 these guys have come a long way  and these cars are proof of that
2 i enjoy driving this car but if i had it to do over i would buy another elantra
2 hyundai has a good reputation and i get over 40 miles per gallon on trips
1 i commute mainly on the highway about a 70/30 split between highway and city streets and i average 27 mpg
2 have been running a test with this tank of gas and keeping car at 6
1 my overall review is do not buy a hyundai or kai
1 you would be better off with some other vehicle
1 i will never ever buy another hyundani or kai
2 i own a kai soul also
2 bought this car after reading reviews and test drove looking at the mpg listed on the sticker
2 well my mileage has been lousy and i complained to hyundai corporate and all they are doing in giving me the run around sending a speedsheet to track my mileag
1 your view of this car will vary depending on what type of vehicle you are coming out of
1 you need to take a good test drive of the elantra before making a final decision
1 the mpg is good not great but good
1 i once got 38mpg doing 65mph when doing 70/75mph i get 32-35mpg
2 in the city where we do most of our driving we avg 20-25mpg
2 we bought this car because my wife was expecting
1 its about how you drive the car that determines the fuel mileage not what a sheet of paper says
1 we feel as though the mileage for any car will be the same for every person and every environment based on its window sticker at the dealership
2 should have bought a subaru or honda civic for the price vs mileage
2 much worse than i planned for and very poor at being honest about it all
1 a lot of car for the money but don't expect great fuel economy
2 i bought a 2013 base model with auto transmission
1 only option was the auto rearview mirror with homelink
1 the homelink system comes with a built in compass 3 garage door openers auto dimming at night and hyund
1 i like hyundai as a car company
2 i get emails service reminders and let's not forget 100k ! a certified master auto tech i chose this car for the reputation value and dependability
2 i bought this car after reading recommendations from consumer reports
2 i am not impressed overall with hyundai and will probably not buy another one
2 i have owned the 2013 elantra coupe since 07/2012 & am already scouring the internet to find a replacementany body got a ?
2 i have been very impressed with my 2013 hyundai elantra
2 my daughter just bought one as well and she loves it
2 i also have a sonata limited and this car is equally fun to drive for a lot less cost
2 i'd give this car a perfect ten if i had the engine broken in but to be fair i gave the acceleration a 9 because i haven't put the peddle to the medal for fear of breaking in the engine !
2 i like this car my wife loves it so i'm a happy camper
1 i just rented this car car was brand new only 940 miles on it
2 car drove good gas tank runs small
2 came homedrove my honda and felt like i was driving a tank compared to the elantra
2 i feel i was taken advantage of because of hyundai's inflated advertised gas mileage of 28 to 40 mpgthe car felt good and is roomy but the main reason i bought it was because of gas mileage
2 again not dissapointed by buying an elantra
1 the industry still has not caught up to hyundai
2 with the design of the easy to usecontrol center my eyes are never off the road for more than a second or two
2 this 2013 se-coupe m/t is probably the best small car i've ever !
2 for the money i would do it again
1 so i felt it necessary to comment on the gas mileage
2 i have just over 4000 miles on this car
1 most of my driving is highway at speeds around 70
2 until last fillup my mileage has increased with every tank
2 my last tank i averaged 355 mpg
1 hyundai quality is not anywhere near toyota or honda
1 dont believe the consumer magazines
1 tim b wrote an exellent appraisal of the elantra and i concur with his review
2 in short i love my elantra and intend to drive it for many years
1 folks this is not a luxury vehicle keep this in mind when you are reviewing the car
2 i really like my 2013 elantra and i'm glad i bought it
1 in town gas mileage is not as good as rated
2 my average mileage with a combination of highway and town driving is about 28 mpg
2 if mine is listed in the recall i will most likely sell and never go back to hyundai
2 just purchased new 2013 gls
1 last auto 2010 corolla averaged 34 mpg
1 passenger thought i hadn't started car when i went to backup
1 i drove a civic and it was to low to the ground small inside and hard to get in and out of
1 toyota has nothing in this size that is very stylish after all i don't want just good gas mileage i also want a great looking
2 purchased through costco program
2 $25k list price bought for $ 22k with extended warranty comfortable ride for 62' driver
1 nothing wrong with this car
1 the digital readout of mpg fluctuates !
2 i drive 40miles round trip to work 90% is freeway and the mpg goes from 27 to 38mpg
2 this car rides nice with comfortable seats
1 it has above average styling fit and finish
2 nice handling and good acceleration and gets around 30 mpg not 40 mpg
1 you will receive a 5 year free roadside assistance and a 10 yr power train warranty for worry
1 i did a great deal of research and test drove the cars on my short list
2 except for the visibility problem i am happy with this car and think i picked the best of the batch according to my criteria
1 better visibility in another car would not compensate
1 some good &some bad things = only a fair car i hope this trend of cheaper materials & higherr prices ends soon
2 on the good side is the warranty all 3 of my hyundais were bought from the same dealer never a problem with service
1 i would like to see a lit
1 the elantra is a near unbeatable car
2 the only thing is it is missing is less than superb drivability
1 it is still nice to drive
1 it is nice to drive not exciting to drive
2 very pleased with !
1 get this car you won't be disappointed
1 you hear things like the vents are to low wrong i've had to use the air on it this summer and it hits me just right
1 gas mileage is great so far
2 the steering seems to be an issue with some but you get used to it
1 unless hyundai starts producing horrible cars i will probably buy a new one in about 5 years
1 in order to get great mileage as advertised you can't have a heavy foot during excelleration
2 i use the cruise control a lot even in town to maintain and adjust speed which also helps the mileage
1 definitely would recommend it as a commuter
1 other that the mpg this car is great
2 i am very happy with my car
2 my car buying experience was very pleasant i did not feel pressured or stressed
1 hyundai seems to understand that good customer service is what sells cars and keeps customers coming back
1 i have a whole new view of hyundai automotive engineering capability

1 the car was towed to the dealer and was told by local dealer and the manufacture that
1 gas mileage is not what is stated or even close
1 seat seam uncomfortable shifter is clumsy could have put leds in mirror and door lock switches
1 great value compared to other vehicles in this class
1 car is stylish and even fully loaded isn't overly pricey
2 i drove the sentra and dart loved the turbo engine but when it came to the bottom line the others weren't close

1 i comparison shopped the honda civic i have owned four the scion nissan mazda ford focus and fiesta toyota corolla chevy cobalt and dodge dart
2 im satisfied with the price and performance and for me that says alot cuz im a picky fat man to put it politely
2 brakes need to be addressed/recalled to be corrected
1 hyundai needs to work on a permanent solution to cosmetics with regard to the finish of the paint and
2 high maintenance and not a smooth ride
1 no get up and go
2 already in the shop with only 500 miles on the car
1 get the gls with preferred package and you're set
2 decent enough car but i feel cheated into it through false mpg claims
1 hyundai has lost my trust and therefore i will not be purchasing any of their future vehicles
2 love my car
2 i ran out of room in my cons so to continue i wish the rear seat armrest had a window in it to pass through skis pipes and other long objects without folding down the seats
1 nice feature i've had in past cars
1 i can see myself driving elantras as long as they are being manufactured
2 our current 2009 honda civic and previous honda fit both have lower epa mileage estimates than the elantra but get better mileage same driving70% highway and 30% cityyou will be lucky to get 30 mpg with 70% highway driving on the elantra

2 i'm getting along quite well with the car

2 the engine is smooth and there is no power lag when passing or when you need speedand you will feell that power
2 great vehicle so far i have only had it for 2 weeks

1 test drove about 10 suv's and this was the best choice by !
1 coming from a sedan it's going to take a bit to mold to me
2 i miss the cornering and tightness of the auto but love sitting higher

1 sanfa fe 24l is a great suv overall its have lots of standard feature and cool blue light bluetooth is easy to use
1 tailgate is easy to close when at full open
2 very pleased with around the city and highway drivinggreat suv for a road tripwould recommend this vehicle for anyone in the market for a midsize crossover suv
1 driving lights and a power liftgate are nice options but they're certainly not a deal breaker for the santa fe

2 owned for six months and 11000 miles2013 hyundia santa fe front wheel drive basic package
2 could not be happier with the features and performance for the money as long as the car over time does not develope problems caused by cost cutting assembly and design flaws
1 hyundai santa fe is a family crossover sporty look very nice design and fun to drive
1 i reviewed mazda honda toyota and ford models before settling on the santa fe none of the other brands could provide the performance/quality/options for the same price
1 i would and have told friends they must drive one
1 then buy one
1 test drive the navigation before you buy this car and make sure you can live with it
1 i would encourage people looking for a nice size sedan with all the bells & whistles to purchase this !
1 after extensive testing/rentals of new cars coming from a very comfortable fully loaded sporty 250+ hp sedan i don't miss iti tested the sonata hybrid and the 20 turbo and didn't find any significant benefits: gas milage in the hybrid is not so go
1 the car has superb stylingride and comfort !
1 no wonder the altima and fusion copied it !
1 this car !
1 the best for !
2 i would buy this car again in a second and highly recommend it to others
2 this is my second sonata
2 i have a 2012 with the manual transmission and the 2013 with the auto
1 gas mileage is much better than my v6 maxima but the maxima was more fun to drive manual transmission with a sportier ride
2 wouldn't by another one
1 do not get this car if you think your going to get 35 mpg highway because it's not going to happen not even close
2 it is a very nice car to drive
2 finish looks very nice as long as you do not drive it anywherequality issue with finishes and blue linkextremely poor customer service
1 compared the malibu fusion and camry and ended up with the sonata se
2 the camry was a close second choice but didn't drive or handle as well as the sonata & the it looked blah next to the sonata
2 looks good rides good but i wouldn't buy one again
1 don't buy 20t
2 very happy with my purchase
1 this car is a very good choice if your buying a new car
1 easy to work on if you do your own maintenance like oil and filter changes
1 i am very impressed with hyundai quality and performance
1 i plan on sticking with hyundai since they have such a variety of styles 16 year old first car to suv's with 3rd row seat
2 i am very pleased with my 2013 sonata
2 overall hyundai did an excellent job balancing gas mileage and performance and skimped in the areas which are easily upgradeable in the aftermarket area for the base model
1 i wanted something that would be best on gas and lowest on the monthly payments
1 sonata has good mileage averaging 26 mpg with 50/50 hwy and city
1 if hyundai can fix the road noise issue it will be even more popular
1 this car is a home run
1 if you are in the market you can not go wrong here
2 nicest car i've owned  the se stance and the venitian red paint is just gorgeous !
1 we're getting 36-37 mpg on road trips or my 69 mile commute
1 i had never driven a hyundai until i test drove this vehicle
1 i was pleasantly surprised and was hooked
1 if you are looking for a stylish reliable vehicle with enough bells and whistles for a not so expense price then take a look at the hyundai sonata

1 however after leasing a 2004 santa fe i am now totally sold on hyundai
1 the car is without a doubt the bang for the buck
1 do some test drives and see for yourself

1 we narrowed the choice down to several cars specifically the sonata altima camry optima and acc
1 for the money i think this car is great
1 i really liked the nissan altima but was not impressed with the warranty and price
1 i have a very nice car for a lot less money and a ten year !
2 i like the car after driving camry's for the last 13 years is is a refreshing difference
2 one of the best vehicles that i have owned
1 i have owned a couple dozen over my lifetime from jaguars to kias
2 we switched from a nissan altima 35 10 years 180k to the hyundai sonata which was a difficult decision
2 we have put about 5k miles on the car including trips and couldn't be happier with our purchase
1 the sonata is at a crossroads as to where it wants to go from here
1 it has been floating around at near the top of its class for awhile now but when will see the next step ?
1 beautiful color sporty styling my 18 yr old grandson loves it
1 a lot of perks for the money as well as the guarantees
1 i just fell in love with this car and overjoyed 
1 from 1-10 i give it a 2
1 you would be better off buying a kia optima honda accord or even a toyota camry
1 get out there and drive one then buy !
1 definite 9+
1 better gas better power and looks a heck of a lot better

2 we have put our first 12000 miles in with zero trips to the dealer and no complaints
1 an excellent car value with a stylish look
2 we have received many compliments on the look of the car and most are shocked when we say it's a hyundai
1 hyundai has really stepped it up and i'm sure we will be seeing many more hyundai's on the road
1 have previously owned camrys but would recommend this carlove it
1 a very good handling car on the highway and on the street
1 and great on gas
2 we were going straight to the nissan dealership but on a whim stopped by the hyundai dealership across the street took a test drive then went straight to the office and purchased the !
2 have had this car limited for three months
2 other than minor annoyances mentioned this has been an outstanding car
2 would buy again
2 plain and simple i was impressed with the test drive and walked off the lot with my sonata 1 hour later
1 better gas better power and looks a heck of a lot better
1 i am not sure how many would believe me but i trade in by bmw 328i for this vehicle
2 it handles great seats are comfortable and the vehicle takes long or short ride very
1 great deal on any model hyundai at the moment take a peek for !
1 it's probably better suited for a teenager
2 i'm not thrilled with mine at all
1 its was close between the sonata and the mazda 6 but the mazda was more with less stuff though it drove a little better it didnt warrent the extra cost and it doesnt even come to the power the sonata
1 for the style and overall comfort you can't go wrong
1 i never thought hyundai would get my vote
2 i would buy another hyundia again
2 this sonata is accutally my second
2 i had owned a '09 elantra beofre this and had no issues what so ever
1 so we upgraded to the bigger sonata and have not looked back
1 do something about the passenger seats and mirrors lower it some
2 i really love my car it serves the purposes we bought it for and we got many features for a lot less then other comparable optioned vehicles
2 i owned an elantra
2 salesman made me do it
2 and the warranty is exceptional
2 we were almost ready to by an suv santa fe/crv but one drive in the 2013 sonata and we fell in love
2 not a bad car for the money but i probably would have gone with something else had i done my research
2 overall the car rides nice but there are a few defect with my 2013 sonata
1 lets see if hyudai will come through on this
1 i had a 2004 sonata for 8 years that i just loved
1 the 2013 i just like
2 this car is fine for me now but i probably would purchase a smaller vehicle next time
1 with the price of gasoline today a car with lousy gas mileage gets downgraded badly by this problem
2 the car is sharp -no doubt; after 7 months of ownership i still do a double take after parking and walking away the acceleration lag is annoying to me but i think i am getting used to it and if you ask my wife it has led me to better driving habbits
2 i seldom purchase the same make of car twice but  i'll make hyundai my first choice when i start looking for another car
2 i'll probably be keeping this to pass down to one of my grandchildren
1 i have had the car for three weeks and have just under 3000 miles and it has been a joy to drivei drive 50000 miles a year so this car is comfortable for me
1 definitely recommend years ahead of the bland accords and camry's fusions look good but i bet no one gets 47mpg
1 excellent automobile that offers all the bells and whistles for the average person
2 i've owed camry's accords and mercedes andam extremely satisfied with my new 2013 hybrid
1 am looking at buying one as a replacement for 17 year old car
1 the car handles well can fend for itself on the interstate
2 we like this vehicle and are very pleased with our purchase
2 great on fuel - fun to drive - i'll never be able to get my wife out of this vehicle
1 don't underestimate this smaller end crossover
2 my 6'3friends aren't afraid to ride in my car they actually prefer !
2 i would not purchase another hyundai for three reasons: 1 the dealership was unfair in negotions  2 the tires were poor and wore out too soon w/no warranty and 3 it is not good on gas
1 overall its a good car for someone looking to get the maximum value
2 it has some cons but its looks great drives even better and it will make you smile every time you drive it
2 first time owner of a hyundaisee how it does when we take a trip in a couple months
2 love my hundai
2 love driving it around the denver metro area during the week and up to the mountains on the weekends
2 will definitely consider purchasing this vehicle again when it's time to update
2 very comfortable good milage few problems
1 if there is a better buy in the small suv market i've yet to find it

2 except for the spongy breaks i can live with the rest
1 i'm not the constant driver of this car it's the wife's so driving this from time to time is ok with me
1 if it were mine all the time i think i would have returned it  i really hate spongy breaks
1 don't waste your time researching this car
2 we were between the crv and the tucson and the heated seats on the gls tipped the scales for us
1 i also like the gauge cluster and dash look better on the tucson
2 this car makes our 1000 mile treks to our daughter in college pleasurable
2 our second hyundai
1 if you are considering a crossover suv the tuscon fits the style comfort and afforadability for today's families
2 the gas mileage is great for an awd we're getting close to !

2 i don't think you can get a nicer faster more equipped car for the money period
2 this is the 5th infiniti in the family and they have all been beautifully made cars
1 the g37x is a bmw killer for much less money

2 best car i have ever owned

2 i love this vehicle - other than the headrest on the front seats
1 it's uncomfortable if you lean back to take a nap as a passenger
1 the seats were initially a little hard during a long trip
1 overall i truly miss my old qx56
1 it was simpler and i don't think that any of the interior changes were for the better
1 this suv instills great confidence in it's ride performance and roadworthiness while at the same time offering comfort for the passengers
1 i hope i am eventually able to figure out the touch screen without having an accident
1 i think it is beautiful and it is supposed to get better gas mileage than the g37x
1 the performance would be better than the g37 were it not for the run flats
1 infiniti is not the japanese bmw anymore with this offering
1 exceptional fit finish and tight handling
1 the most important thing in infiniti cars are that nissan don't install that piece of junk cvt transmissions which kills all the beauty engine performance i love infiniti and i always will
1 the car is just an overall exhilarating machine and a pleasure to drive around
2 quality feature set is just right quiet no road noise is coming into the cabin except 37 liter engine roar when pushed
2 i'm delighted with my new q50 awd hybrid
2 the car drives beautifully and it's packed with features bells and whistles
1 having owned infiniti vehicles in the past the q50 is nothing like anything they have built !
2 as an overall comparison we also own a 2013 cadillac ats4 premium 36 and a 2013 bmw 335 x-drive luxury line and the q50 s awd
2 i am very happy with the q50 sport hybrid
1 it's very fast and satisfying everytime i drove itin term of performance pricing and option there is just not a car that can compete with it currentlyi highly recommend you go test drive one if you haven't
1 infiniti has really hit a home run with the q50
1 based on looks alone this is a super car
1 i like the es350 better better ride and better navagation center 
2 the system has to boot when the car starts and will spontaneously reboot occasionally while driving
1 this clears the navigation system and resets all the controls

1 overall i give the q50 a 10 !
1 its combination of luxury & performance is a step  or two above others in its class !
2 i will go back to my audi in 2-3 years when i trade again
2 i've driven infinitis for the past 12 years and i have found them relatively trouble free and nicely designed particularly the first generation g sedan and coupe of which i owned both

1 do yourself a favor and check out the jaguar xjl - this car sets the standard for luxury cars imho
1 i've also heard a few reviewers complain that the park assist screen stays on after you go from reverse to drive
2 have had the car only a little more than a month
1 a pure delight thus far
2 we'll see how it holds up over time

1 if you are thinking about purchasing a mid-size suv this one is well worth the investment
2 overall i couldn't be more pleased with my purchase and anticipate long lines to get the trailhawk model; she's a beast

1 it handled them all amazingly
1 it is better looking in person
1 photographs don't do it justice
2 we have gotten lots of compliments
1 he really catered to my needs
1 when i finally do decide to buy i will fly down to la just to buy from him
2 in the end the other attributes of the cherokee overcame my disappointment with cargo space making the 2014 jeep cherokee a !
1 jeep outdid theirselves with this one
1 go and test drive one !
1 you will not be !
1 i'm in the market for a compact suv in the near future and this one is the clear leader
1 for suburbanites like me the limited will be just right
1 the mazda cx-5 is nice so is the ford escape
2 we love our new cherokee
2 we had to wait quite awhile for it but it sure seems worth the wait
2 we bought the limited with almost every option
1 clearly best ride in the class
1 doesn't have the power of my grand cherokee with the v8 hemi but then i didn't expect it to and it sure gets better gas mileage
1 i looked at chevy nissan
2 all i can say is a pleasant surprise to find a great smaller suv with a lot of perks for a pretty low pricewith great mileage
1 being brand-loyal to chrysler products and with the price offered it was an easy choice to make
1 i seriously considered and researched competitors but did not find the higher prices for the competitors justified with respect to potential increased perf
1 good basic vehicle for northern climate
2 big improvement from the 2012 patriot that i traded in even though the insides are idential
1 that cut down on having to adjust to a new car much less engine noise and it has the feel of a passinger car
1 it is among the best of the best
2 not a totally bad vehicle if i did not have all the electrical problems i would be pleased with the vehicle
1 also if they were not ongoing i would fill better giving the vehicle a high rating
2 right now far from the most satisfied customer
1 decent ride and capable jeep
1 but even for 55k it is still a jeep
1 tens of thousands cheaper than range rover with the same options but will be in the shop as much as a range rover
1 however with the range rover you will at least have service reps pretend
2 had the vehicle for 3 days and the electronic dash board went blank
2 6 days later the navigation system went blank
2 a week later the radio screen froze
2 i have not had any problems with the jeep in 7 months of ownership
1 the grand cherokee is an excellent choice we were considering several vehicles in the same segment when we decided to go with the grand cherokee and i wouldn't have it any other way
2 overall i'm been completely statisfied with my 2014 gc overland
2 no major problems
1 advise- read the manuals and know your build !
1 4k on it so far and i still really like the looks of the gcthe 8 speed tranny is nice except at low acceleration it's a little lungy getting from 1st to 4th gearit tows my atv's with ease with the 57l hemi; although that comes at a price at the pump
2 overall its a great truck - it's a shame they couldn't get the electronics right before releasing it
2 very pleased with the vehicle overall great fuel mileage quick smooth shifting and all the luxury we wanted
1 wish leather and power seats were available on laredo 4x4
2 overall this is the nicest vehicle i have ever owned
2 i hope to keep it at least 10 years
2 exactly what i was looking for and performs up to my expectation
1 very unique towing capacity without going to a pick up truck and sacrificing sporty performance
2 i drove a durango for 10 years and needed a replacement but wanted luxury 4x4 large vehicle and good fuel economy
1 first vehicle i've come across that fits this profile
2 love love love my new cherry red jeep
2 i read the reviews before i bought my 2014 grand 
1 the new electrontics far more than any other grand 
2 with it comes a few problems like anything else
2 had remote installed not one problem with it but to read the reviews you would think it was the last
2 worst vehicle i have ever owned
1 dealerships with employees that know nothing about the vehicles they are supposed to be doing service on
1 repeatedly blown off and treated like i was crazy
2 problems were intermittent and unpredictable
2 i am very happy to have bought another jeepit compares to the ml and is more enjoyable than an audi q5 egg salad without mayo
2 i am very pleased with this vehicle which replaced my 11 year old grand cherokee
2 i liked the old one but this is a step up in terms of luxury and performance
2 you could spend less and get one of the other versions of the grand cherokee but my decision to but the summit was based on the ride and the appearance
1 overall it is a great vehicle and i am a jeep lover so we will get along well
2 i have only had this for about a month now and am still learning my way around it
2 i have only had this for about a month now and am still learning my way around it
1 a dealer should be more informed on how to help a comsumer not familiar with a very nice equipment
2 overall i am extremely happy with my liberty
2 thanks to jeep's cash incentives and dealership discounts the price of this new vehicle was a bargain
2 i went from a grand cherokee to a liberty
1 mostly what i notice is the somewhat smaller interior
1 other than that i really like this jeep
2 it looks great and rides very well
1 i would also say it is much quieter than my 2004 gc was
1 i like this vehicle's ride comfort size and drivability
2 this is my 2nd jeep liberty and the 12th jeep in my family
2 we have never had any issues with our jeeps and have always loved that they would make it through any winter that was thrown at them
1 time has only improved this ability
1 its got more of a truck feel than alot of other suvs and a bit of a higher stance
2 it's an ok vehicle but if i had been able to forsee the problems i would not have purchased it
2 good vehicle to own
2 good rugged american style vehicle needs a little refinement
2 it tows a camping trailer well is good off road handles and ride comfortably is practically sized and after a year of ownership has been perfectly reliable
1 after owning a 2002 dodge durango for 10 years i wanted an suv that i would love to drive as much as the durango
2 i purchased a 2012 jeep patriot but only owned for 3 months just was not right for me cheap interior seats uncomfortable and no power
2 for us we could not have a better vehicle
2 we looked for a long time and knew this was the right truck for us
2 we also have a 2008 sebring hardtop convertible and the two vehicles have identical controls and dash layout hands free phone and navigation
2 not a commuter at 16mpg but its a strong heavy truck and you feel safe in it
2 wife and i love the looks comfort and amenities
1 looked for 'american' !
2 i feel great that i bought an 'american' vehicle that looks cool rides well and is comfortable
1 if you like a more car like ride on the road this is not the vehicle for you
2 you'd be better off looking at crossoversoverall i'm happy with my purchase
2 it's exactly what i expected after much research and i'm proud to park it next to my husband's w
1 sorry they're not making them anymore
2 have had hardly any trouble with any of my jeeps
1 guess i'll look at the new cherokee next
1 put a good set of tires on it and you're ready to !
2 i bought it before productions discontinued !
2 we bought the jeep as a replacement for my thirteen-year-old college car
2 we've owned it now for six months and with the exception of the roof side rails and the amount of gas we go through we are happy with our purchase
1 i drove it about 10 times and i just don't like it
1 i rented one of these for a week in hawaii and i wanted to share my experienceall vehicles are tradeoffs - you trade weight for space or gas mileage for performance
1 however this seems to be a vehicle with all downsides while offering no benefits in
2 great suv amazingly capable and reminds me of previous cherokee
2 despite poor gas mileage you won't be driving the new cherokee disappointment set out by jeep
2 great truck tough strong good control feels great while driving
2 i recommend it for people who like the feel of a real truck but want something that's not tremendous and takes up lots of space
1 drive before you buy
1 i like the fact it's built in ohio with a great deal of domestic content and american labor
2 mine has been very reliable
2 i use synthetic fluids and follow all maintance requiremnts and i did bring the noise of a driveline clunk to the dealers attention
2 love my vehicle and if gas mileage and engine power on takeoff were improved it would be a major contender
1 after reading auto magazines reviews i almost did not consider test driving this vehicle
1 i gave it a test drive and i could not believe i was in the same vehicl
2 it gets me great gas mileage for my 42 mile one way commute everyday and makes me feel safe in the suv body
2 i have the 2012 jeep patriot latitude and i love the little bells and whistles i !
1 heated leather seats navigation satellite
1 it is priced right
1 great cheap suv on the budget with great gas mileage
2 the perfect family jeep: great for retirees as the main vehicle
1 pricing very affordable
1 would give a 10 out of !
2 i normally drive toyotas so this was an unusual vehicle choice for me
1 i wanted a manual transmission and toyota doesn't offer one in the rav4
2 it took a lot of searching to find a nicely equipped patriot with the 5 speed transmission but it was worth it
1 if you want fancy them this might not be for you
1 colors are limited but good
1 not a van and not a car but a very good choice for something in between
2 i just went over the 200k mile mark on my 2004 tacoma
1 if toyota doesn't get real and deal a little better on the rave4 they wanted $6k more for a base model with auto trans compared to the jeep i will be buying anothe
2 would buy another in a heartbeat
2 12000 miles not one problem
2 i would purchase this vehicle again
1 i actually drove 8 hours in poor weather conditions to pick up my 2011jeep patriot
2 it handled so well i was no doubt impressed when it got me home safely in blizzard like conditions
2 it's perfect for me and my family we love driving it
1 perfect vehicle for the average suburban or country driver
1 very capable of taking on unexpected road conditions
1 other than the very dangerous ignition problem a good vehicle
2 this is my second one
1 this vehicle is very affordable
2 again for the price i could not be happier
1 it is a jeep it is well optioned roomy and gets good gas mileage
2 mine has 50000 miles on it and i've loved driving it for each one
2 very happy with my purchase
2 worst car new or used i have ever owned
1 my next car won't be a jeep
2 i am glad i purchased this vehicle
1 it is the most vehicle for the money if you need all wheel drive
2 great for my family of four
2 easy to pack up for weekend trips to beach or mountains and those trips to grocery store
1 not worth it
2 it's nice to know when unpredictable weather hits i have the vehicle that's ready
1 the 4wd in jeep's are in a category by themselves
1 no other vehicle can do it better
2 wish i had bought it new but used is just fine for !
2 this is my first jeep and wonder why i didn't buy one years ago
2 it's cool you know what you are getting into when buying a wrangler so don't expect a smooth ride or luxury
2 i have the unlimited in black and it is sweet keeping it clean is a different matter
2 thats why i got it
2 surprises me for gas mileage and how they hold their !
2 i truly enjoy driving my jeep i even let my husband drive it on the weekends when i'm not working
2 i feel safe driving in a vehicle that is higher up
1 i have even learned to do the jeep !
1 to summ it all up
1 aggressively styled luxuriously appointed appropriately powered and generously priced
1 there really is no competition to this cadenza it has set the benchmark for affordable luxury for the working class
1 2014 kia cadenza has entered the scene and is starting to build its reputation with a bang
1 having captured a first and second place victory in recent comparison test versus the competition this new kia is on its way
1 exterior of new cadenza will remind
1 great car for the money- and i drove at all of the competition
1 none could compare
1 test drove one of these while i was waiting for my parents maxima to be serviced
1 it needs work badly
1 its horribly underpowered the transmission is indecisive and very slow to shift
1 it will not downshift unless you put the pedal to the floor
2 being a loyal gm owner for the last 20+ years it was time to move on
2 buying this kia has not let me down
1 gm it's time to wake up and smell the coffee
2 great family car with fully loaded
2 this is my first kia car and i have amazed quality of this car
2 it is definitely the best choice for my family
2 wouldn't hesitate to buy another
2 this car really surprised me
1 comfort quite and overall a will made car
1 i was looking at the lincoln mkz first
2 but this car was hands down the better of the two
1 all i can say is two words test driveone
1 before you buy any car in this class do y
2 you get your monies worth cant believe this is a kia
1 wish it had remote start
1 this car was a definite surprise
1 once you test drive this car you will appreciate its quality and details
1 this car is no german engineering from focus driving dynamics perspective but if you are in the market for a comfortable cruiser with great styl
2 great car and the dealership was one of the best i have ever done business with
2 i will probably go back to the lexus ls - my old 2000 ls400 was more enjoyable to own  ride in and to driveonly 1700 miles and almost 4 months of ownership i am disappointed
1 one of the best cars i've ever driven
2 only own this for about 2 months but am very happy
1 styling has a wow factor amongst my contemporaries in business
2 if you can find one at a dealership buy it you will not find a better car value
1 everything about this car speaks luxury and safety with great handling and power
2 the sound system is one of the best and i can even put pictures of the family on the screen
2 if you're looking for a car that has all the options of a an expensive car but is reasonably priced buy a cadenza
2 this was a very good choice for me coming from a 1999 mitsubishi diamante
2 i like luxury without the badge and wanted a car that i feel i can live with for many years
1 the cadenza fits the bill
2 this was a very good choice for me coming from a 1999 mitsubishi diamante
2 i like luxury without the badge and wanted a car that i feel i can live with for many years
1 the cadenza fits the bill
1 if you test this car you will buy it
2 have had it about two months and love it
2 had previously driven infinitis and cadillacs but this is one of the best
1 it is worth taking a test drive to experience a car that is a better value with all of the features it offers than the competition
1 luxury at a managable price with all the luxo items u would find in a higher priced car
2 warranty can not be touched by any luxo car at a much higher price
1 i highly recommend this car for at least a test drive it will sell itself
1 good value with the best warranty on the msrket
2 very happy
2 over all i'm very pleased was the easeiest new car buy i ever had in and out in under 3hrs
2 and like i said earlier the car is well built i will keep it way past the 10yrs
2 fantastic car 30 mpg around town and 36 on highway
1 this car handles very well
1 gas mileage is awesome
2 purchased the fully loaded ex model
1 the outside body design is sharp distinctive styling particularly its tail lampsrunning lights and hid headlights
1 this is a nice car however you might want to look for something more economical if most of your driving is in the city
2 i wish i had leased the higher end upgrade with electric seats
2 i was kind of used to them with my sorrento but overall i love this car
1 between the sorrento the soul and this forte i have become a real kia fan
2 i do not have too much to complain about
2 excellent vehicle great price great dealership
2 check out the kia before you spend more on a different brand
1 this 2014 kia forte ex is one of the best cars i test drove and you get your moneys !
2 i have saved hundereds off dollars in fuel so far since april when i purchased it
1 love th select shift 6 speed trans/wich is standard
2 love this car can't wait until i can take it out on the highway
1 over all this is a remarkably good looking car with more than moderate performance for the money
1 any improvements would cost an additional 10 to 15 g the driving feel of the car and the fit and finish make it a winnerplus it has a five year 100000 k
1 when i was shopping for a car i looked at the kia rio due to it being very stylish and cheap but what turned me off to it was that it doesn't even a spare !
1 it comes with a fix-a-flat can which is only useful in certain situations
2 nice little carbut im not only disapointed im very unhappy with the purchase based on the transmission problem and the customer service is completely unaceptable
1 that's a smart asnewr to a difficult question
2 it has great features it's spacious and you will be happy you bought it when you see the savings in your gas budget
1 you'll have more money to spend for !
2 i just love my new vehicle
2 i test drove everything and i do mean everything from a honda/nissan/ford up to a $40k sport utility truck and then choose a kia
2 i would rate my kia rio an 85 out of 10
2 i have 17k on it and no problems at all
1 i average 40-41 mgg
2 i can't say enough good about it & would and do recommend it to anyone who's interested in buying a small car
1 decent car not going to win any races but still a good solid car
1 is it a luxury ?
1 nope but it has a lot of tech those vehicles have
2 quite satisfied through this early mileagethe true test comes at 25000 and then 50 000 etc
2 look if you want to get ac but not pay a lot for a car this one is itmy car is as basic as anything built but totally fulfills my needs retired mid-
2 so far so good but i have had the car only a week
2 great car for the money i got high end features such as backup camera power mirror and power folding mirrors for the same price as base models of other vehicles
2 i work for kmmg and i drive 80 miles a day or about 480 miles a weeki got the car in march 2012 and have 20890 miles and i have had know truble out of it
2 all i have had to do is the schedule maintenance 
1 i also get about 375 miles to the gal
2 easy to work with dealer
1 it's inexpensive relatively fuel efficient and spacious for a compact car
1 this is a 2012 5 door 500 miles on it
1 call it a long test drive
1 wanted a get around town carthat was reliable and low cost in purchase price and came with long term reliability and warranty
2 i had a pt cruiser and was happy with it except the milage was bad
1 i compared the chevy spark the ford focus they came in second and the chysler 200
1 rio won most bang for the buck review
2 all in all i dislike this car and cannot wait to trade it
2 only 3000 miles on the clock - anone ?
1 a worth buying little car
1 see my review of 2009 kia rio5 before considering purchasing 2011
1 go drive a toyota sienna and a honda odyssey
2 you will end up paying a lot more for a lot less
1 it could be a little more modern looking it looks kind of a senior citezens van
1 lots of seating easy to get in and out of and lots of storage
2 the quiet but powerful v6 coupled with a smooth 6 speed transmission is superb
1 great handling and cornering the sedona handles more l
1 drive it  you will love it
1 buy one !
2 the very best vehiclewe have ever owned
1 it is like driving a sports carvery fun to drive
2 will never buy another chrysler van
2 will never buy another chrysler van
2 best dang vehicle i've had in 25 !
1 my last favorite was a 1987 colt vista
1 a test drive is not good enough to write a review about any vehicle owning it is
2 after three months of ownership i couldn't be happier
1 have fun with it do the land rover off road events wnjoy the looks
1 for the deals you can get on an lr2 it not only undercuts the x3 q5 glk and xc60 by thousands but even beats a loaded tiguan escape etc
2 it has made light of snow ice mud and country roads in all weather conditions
2 it is equipped with all the goodies one could wish for - a list too long to detail here - and i have put my money where my mouth is
1 riding on a lighter aluminum platform and dropping the base v8 in favor of a supercharged v6 the new range rover sport is certainly sportieri saw it in land rover north dade and now i must buy it till has good !
1 if you don't have the new range rover get one now
1 great for 1-2 person commute
1 this vehicle is not worth the risk
1 manufacturer does not support their product
1 land rover took a big risk in america on this compact suv they needed a better fuel economy asset vehicle to stay competitive and relevant in the market place
1 they created a beautiful car with sleek lines that is 95% true to the prototype we saw a few
2 best city suv have had
1 looking forward to a long trip this fall
1 this suv rides like a dream on the road great power and acceleration
2 it's the only vehicle i've owned that has gotten compliments on its looks and performance
2 no reliability issues in 70000 miles
2 great value and it attracts attention
2 i own a range rover sport gt limited edition and i absolutely love this vehicle
2 though this vehicle was a lease i will be certain to consider another range rover sport after the lease expires
2 i feel safe behind the wheel of this truck
1 i recommend test driving the sport model but if you are looking for more of a soft ride vehicle try the range rover hse non sport model
1 this is also a great vehicle also
2 best off roading vehicle ever
1 yes this car is more expensive
1 we prices a loaded prius leather nav moonroof etc
2 and it was about $1500 less
2 in our minds it was worth it for the service and quality that lexus brings
1 if you don't want an option-loaded car the prius or the ci
1 the fuel economy for the ct is absolutely terrific the car looks good and it handles decently
1 but the rear visibility is perfectly awful
2 i have removed the rear-seat head restraints which helps a little but not enough
1 i am very puzzled as to why ot
1 seriously test drive this car
1 get !
1 you will love it
1 even more so if it had more power
1 this car fits my needs and likes regardless of its tight back seat
1 will be going back in 2 days to try and make a deal
1 a best buy by any measurement
1 it is a nice option if you would not want a prius
1 however you must keep in mind the motor and electric motor is exactly the same of a prius
1 if you don't consider this car you are making a big mistake
2 this is my first lexus and first hybrid vehicle and i ? be more pleased
1 the car is well-appointed with many of the features you find in a similarly priced luxury vehicle
2 this car is outstanding my second hybrid car and i must say the best does not lack any comforts and above all else does not look like a !
2 we had a 2012 es 350 and enjoy the 2013 es 300h more
2 not only is the vehicle excellent but the ownership experience provided by the dealer has continued to be excellent
2 the controls are easy to understand but at first i was less than thrilled with t
2 this is an excellent vehicle overall for those of us who want to save on gas and be eco-friendly without sacrificing luxury
1 the single most important feature in this car is the sport mode
1 it would be hard to merge into highway with 4 cylinder 156 hp limousine size car
1 sport mode is a must to merge into highway from a low speed
1 for 46k plus price of this car is not worth it
1 great appointments inside the cabin
1 i love the way it looks on the street
2 the standard sound system is more than adequate
1 roomy front and back
2 a joy to own and a great valuethe best thing isit doesn't look like a
2 so far it's the best car we ever owned--- it replaced our 2001 es300; we still own a 2007 es350
1 excellent quality great luxury good performance and outstanding mileage for a car of this size
2 my seventh lexus but this one is the best !
2 satisfied with lexus 300 hybird
2 had the car for about a week and really enjoy it
1 if you like a quiet comfortable ride with some sportiness this is the car for you
2 the best vehicle we've ever owned
1 if you're looking for comfort and quality for the money this is definitely the car for you
2 after adding a few extras it is definitely everything we wanted
2 it's comfortable it's good looking gas mileage is acceptab
2 didn't think lexus could improve further from my past vehicles but this one did
2 was about to purchase a 2013 avalon ltd but looked at es 350 and agreed to buy the same day
1 although the avalon and es 350 share numerous systems the overall driving experience in the es 350 is well worth the extra $3k to $4k
2 the ride is quiet and comfortable; my gas mileage seems to be better than quoted; and it takes regular unleaded vs
1 premium required in most luxury cars
2 i only have 1200 miles on it so i can't address me
1 i never thought they could improve on the ones i owned previously but they sure did
1 i can't imagine a better car than this at any price
1 please before bashing lexus for just being and upscale toyota go drive one objectively
1 if creature comfort long term reliability and family are your focus this will be your top 3 consideration
1 yes i have driven
2 very happy with my car
1 just a very nice sedan
2 great car  only have it a week
1 will be getting eth car in 2-3 days and very excited
1 will be getting eth car in 2-3 days and very excited
1 test drove gs a6 m37 avalon accord
1 the es had the best overall package for the money hands down
2 i am loving this car to the utmost
2 it is everything i could ever want in a luxury car for the price
1 very good car love the redesign
1 very good car love the redesign
1 thanks for tkanig the time to post
1 it's lifted the level of debate
1 this won't be the last one that you !
1 quality construction makes this auto a real winner
2 i got the car in march and so far i'd recommend it 
1 ride is not harsh like other sport sedans
1 acceleration is brisk with a little engine sound thrown in
1 for a person that loves an excellent vehicle with performance & handling !
1 overpriced compared to other 4 door luxury sedans especially those made in the us
1 in the less than 100k bracket this lexus 350 is an all around practical but cool car
1 i want to love it but the problems i've had with the luxury features are very !
2 this is my fourth and likely my last lexus
1 i was loaned a porsche panamera for a week and loved it in many ways the gs f sport is comparable with more room in the rear seats
1 there are way too many operating deficiencies to suggest someone lease or purchase this car
2 an unusable remote a car that doesn't sense the season and heat or cool the cabin accordingly
1 no hard drive for music as it must all go through an iphone
1 it is very well appointed
1 i am actually looking forward to my next lexus
1 a gx460 will soon be added to our family
2 although the vehicle handles well the overall complexity of the systems proves both frustrating and distracting creating all too often an unpleasant driving experience
2 i own and operate an independent foreign car repair shop
1 the clown that gave this car two low reviews should be removed from the review listing
2 i traded a 2013 bmw 750i for my 2013 lexus gs350 and so glad i didwatch out bmw here comes lexus
1 it looks similar to the new 2013 altima
2 i love the car but am disappointed at the omissions i mentioned for a car at this price point
2 when you only spend 5% of your time driving in anger you want the other 95% to be served by quiet comfortable compliance
1 however you drive the fierce front end of the f-sport effectively combines class with intimidation
2 almost 10k miles so far and still love the car as much as the day i bought it
1 not worth the money
2 if you get into the lexus family - you'll find that it's easy to stay
2 love intelligent design - and quality that stands the test of time
2 really a gift to be able to drive this !
2 my husband convinved me to purchase this car in may i wanted another benz
2 i've had many cars over the course of my car buying years i'm middle aged : in my early years i owned a few american muscle cars
2 owned this car for 3 monthslight years ahead of the previous model in style and quality
1 a 5 star ride
1 don't listen to the fake reviews on here marking this car down
1 don't base your decision on my review
1 take each side of the story head down to the dealership and base your decision on someone you trust yourself
1 all you have to do is drive one
1 i would pass on this toyota
2 tough choice with a6 & 535 but definitely feel i made right choice
2 like the car more every time i drive it
2 would buy another
1 if i want a great car i'd buy the new cadillac this car is just wrong the styling looks like something from the 80's

2 drives like a dream and handles like none other
1 great car with new sport handling with all the great qualities of lexus
2 i love my new f sport
2 i give this vehicle high ratings for overall comfort and reliability
1 a luxurious ride that makes a driver/passenger feel safe with the solidity of its exquisite engineering
1 outclassed by many of it's less expensive luxury competitors
1 wood sound drive looks = guality
1 this vehicle is almost perfect
1 i dont recomend this car to people who likes good things
2 overall its a great handling car great looking and has the power i need with good gas mileage
1 during this week i have averaged 285 mpg
2 really great car but some first year bugs that need to be ironed out
1 overall i love the car it's every bit a lexus with a kick of sport
2 i have the 350 awd f-sport and i feel like this car rides on rails but the suspense is not as harsh as a bmw or mb
1 i think it looks great and is fun to drive
1 i can see why they say it is better then the bmw 335
2 as i already stated this is the best car and experience i've ever had
1 i test drove the new bmw 3 series and mercedes c class but liked the lexus much more
2 no regrets on my purchase and i highly recommend this vehicle to others
1 just be sure to get t
1 makes the drive in the inner city rush hour a whole lot easier to deal with
1 instead i would spend the extra money and go for the is 350
2 i tried to exchange the car after driving it for one week but the cost to get out of the lease was way too expensive
1 not worth the money far nicer cars out there for this money
1 excellent choice for drivers wanting a great handling car and a reputation for quality and reliability
1 just saw online
1 overall its reliable fast stylish and comfy but it a little to expsensive
1 its a bit pricey but hopefully the price lowers a bit so this great car can be driven by more consumers
1 this car is a patheitc attempt by lexus to make a super car
1 this is a performance car you buy for style and the quality
1 just don't get into any drag races with the new skyline gtr
1 overall if you want luxury this is still the best value
1 i couldnt decide btw ls vs 7 series
2 i went and got a 7 series feels right when you drive any german car
2 i would have rated it all perfect if it the back seat can fit my kids on two can sit fine the middle does not fit any one and uncomfortable
2 after having owned five lexus ls models over the past 16 years i would say without hesitation that this one is my favorite
1 the body style interior comfort technology enhancements and responsiveness leave little room for improvement
1 pricey but nice
2 this is my 3rd lexus but my first ls
2 it was my retirement gift to myself and i fell so fortunate safe empowered and comfortable behind the wheel of my ls
1 be carefull what dealer you buy from 
2 i lot of hidden cost with west palm  florida dealer
2 i can't say enough about this car
2 the audi a7 was wonderful too although the rear seat was tight and the interface for me was more difficult although loved the wifi
2 i have owned 10 lexus ls400 series and this is the best by far
1 you will like passing the disabled bmws along side the road
1 great saftey features
1 its beautiful car with a beautiful eco friendly engine
1 if you get this car you won't regret it
1 rugged as a tank but super luxe this is the perfect vehicle
1 classic beauty without screaming look at me 
1 airbag and safety features throughout
1 when you slam the door you know by the sound that it's
1 newer suv's from mercedes or range rover may have a more updated chassis and power train but this thing is proven and well executed
2 it is a delight to drive and own
2 i am glad i got this vehicle wish i can own !
2 if i could i would have 2
2 i would suggest this car to anyone in the market for a suv
1 nothing to write home about it
2 overall just right for a couple for trips and around town
1 buy a nissan
1 the lexus reputation is what you are buying here
1 toyota corporation has spent billions building up the lexus brand in the past 20 years and it's time to reap those rewards
1 the car is a couple of steps above your toyota/honda/nissan and slightly ahead o
2 i am so happy with this vehicle
2 it drives like a dream
1 buy one you will love !
2 the ride is very smooth
1 the styling is perfect to me
1 i like the enform system with the computer apps
1 great car for a small !
2 very happy with the lexus
2 have always had great luck with the toyota/honda brands
2 felt the ride fit and finish were better than the competitors
1 recommend to test this if you are in the market for a luxury suv/crossover
1 would buy a ford explorer
1 lexus quality and reliability
1 the 2013 rx 350 is a great car
2 owned the car for 6 months
1 does not offer a separate backseat temperature control
2 i got the full upgrade with the navi and wood trims
2 a keeper for the next decade but i did pay for it thru the nose
1 not worth the price
2 would and have highly recommend this vehicle
1 if not overzealous with options price is relatively reasonable vs competition
1 overall the product is declining every year
1 turn in our rx in this year and we are looking to switch to somthing beside a lexus
2 i test drove five other competing suvs before i bought the rx350 and the comfort of the seats and smooth quiet ride tipped the scale for me
2 the v6 with the 6 speed transmission is silky smooth and as an enthusiast with many bmws in my past i don't find
2 i have been driving the 2013 for about 6 months and i love it
1 for a smaller suv you have luxury style with a nice ride
1 unlike a lot of suv's the rx also has reasonable gas mileage rating
2 i have driven this in the winter and the all wheel drive model
2 will always own a lexus
1 best luxury car for the money
1 we tested six suvs in this size/price range and found a lot to like -- and some to dislike -- about each
1 nothing profound there
1 mercedes felt solid but was too small
1 cadillac had power but the cabin felt cheap and plastic-y
1 i am only writing this because i just read so many reviews about how smooth it is
2 i have owned this car for 3 years and can tell you it is not that smooth
1 it's not bad but definitely not a passenger car or like 2009 rx
2 the vehicle handles exceptionally well in snow and ice
2 best car i have ever owned
1 put a moon roof on it and you will have a lot more buyers me included
1 good looking  but ! price for status !
2 wife loves the car so that's all that counts
2 it is a great car except price
1 nice suv but american quality is catching up lexus
1 excellent suv gas mileage from 28-30 quality !
2 spouse and i really like the ride fuel economy and overall workmanship of this vehicle
2 excellent handling suv very user friendly a pleasure to driveexcellent quality suv
1 this is the queen of luxury suvs if you like the styling and lexus craftsmanship you should test out this car if you are in the market for a luxury suv
1 excellent vehicle extremely well appointed
1 i think this is a great car if you're in the market for a big hauler
1 i know it isn't for everyone but i also think it is way underrated and in the large crossover segment of the market for sheer fun to drive as well as luxury and features is has bee
2 except for some inital quality issues i absolutely love this car
2 comfortable super quiet very smooth ride
2 i look forward to driving it for many years
2 excellent car with great service
2 awesome ride had it for 3 weeks find places to go just so i can drive
2 our mkt listed for close to $60000 and we got a great deal
2 the ecco-boost engine is world class but have not yet checked gas mileage
1 if you want refined comfort and safety i would recommend the mkt
1 you will enjoy a quite smooth ride in refined comf
1 this car puts lexus and others to shame especially considering the really poor recent lexus crash tests from the insurance institute
2 for the price i paid hard to compare best in class
1 the unmistakable unique style performance and interior comfort make it an all around winner in this segment
1 not worth the price 
1 luv the car x milage
1 the top of the !
2 love the sync much improved over earlier versions
2 read professional reviewers comments they must not have spent much time with the vehicle as those reviews did not reflect my experiences at all
2 was very impressed by lincoln more people need to test
2 this crossover is a gem and doesn't get the respect from the auto reviewers that it deserves
2 you would be hard-pressed to find a better luxury crossover anywhere right now and we have tried them all
1 drove similar cars and absolutely fell in love with the mkt
2 feels like a rocket with the eco boost
2 great lovely car with so much available amenities and wonderful family hauler
1 i don't work for ford or am i in the car business
1 i do own not lease a number of new cars and typical buy a new car or two every year
2 while i can get bored easily the mks is a keeper for the reasons that i mentioned above
1 hopefully the high rating
1 best car !
2 i previously owned a 2010 mks eco boost and i absolutely loved that car
2 i upgraded to the 2013 mks eco boost and it is a totally different car
2 i've only owned it for about a week and i am already impressed with it and for the naysayers out there that
1 everyone has a cadilacthis is a lincoln baby
2 best car ive ever owen
2 my mks is by far superior to all other vehicles i have ever owned including my previous 09 mks other lincoln models and other brands
1 lincoln really did their homework on this new mks
1 the car rivals all of the luxury vehicles i've seen and tested
1 in value for money it stands apart
2 i get consistent comments about how different the car is from what people who see it had thought
1 it's sporty when you want it to be has an amazing ride
2 i don't even like the dealer i deal with but for this car i'll put up it
1 strictly class comfort and the road is yoursa smile
1 i don't pay any attention to what consumer reports says about cars
1 they're very biased in favor of certain asian makes even when they're not the best
1 this car is a true luxury car and is very safe
1 everyone should give this new lincoln a try lots of standard equipment for the money american luxury is back
2 completely satisfied
1 i've given it all tens
2 will by again - this is my 3rd lincoln
2 you will be missing out if you don't add this vehicle to your list to try
1 love the car really sporty
2 very happy that i purchased fun to drive home from a hard days !
1 i absolutely love the mks after driving cadillacs for 25 years
2 it is responsive quiet and comfortablewho would have ever thought a v-6 could generate so much power from a little 35 liter engine
2 the car is quiet rides well and put together well with a lot of features for the price
2 before you criticize the car for foreign models take it for a test drive
1 it will be hard to find a better car for price
1 many people are saying they like the car
1 lincolnford are making excellent cars
1 i am so surprised that their ratings by a so-called experts are not higher
1 it handles as though it is on a rail there is literally no body roll when cornering it stops sure and straight
2 great car for a reasonable price for all the options you get
2 i have premium and elite package that gives you everything
2 i think the lincoln mks is the best car i have ever owned
1 test drive other cars
1 my last rental was an impala ltz ironically i liked it better
2 had problems with the vent system since i bought the car
2 a/c defrost would periodically vent out on your feet only
2 very much a problem on a hot day or a day when it was raining and you needed a defroster
1 the car is back for the third time in a year f
1 top notchtest drove the rxmdx and grand cherokeenothing !
2 good purchase
1 many of the problems were created by ford/lincoln with the touch system
1 it had way to many bugs in it when they released it and did not have a good patch
2 hazardous navigation system
2 very disappointed
1 it has everything you need for a great driving vehicle
2 the fwd gas milage is better than we thought just under 25 mpg for city driving
1 the mkx has plenty of power under the hood
2 the lincoln my touch works just fine
1 lincoln has outdone itself
2 in order to take advantage of everything the car can do be prepared to read and refer to the owners manual for a while
1 the salesman did a good job of going over all of the options but it's a lot to remember
2 as i drive it i occasionally need to look
2 would be an almost perfect vehicle except for the frustrating my lincoln touch issues
2 excellent vehicle i have no complaints
1 all the comforts that a vehicle should have beutiful interior gorguos leather seat's and trim exquisitly done with perfection
1 more features come standard with this vehicle than most
2 i made a very poor choice when i bought this car
2 we are very pleased that we purchased this car after spending a lot of time looking at the comparable vehicles from other mfgs
2 i went back to the dealer i bought the car from and was told there was nothing they could doi notified the company but the company totally ignored my complaint
2 i am not sure i will buy another lincoln again
1 test drove buick enclave and the cadillac crossover and this car beat both cars
2 i lease my vehilces and would recommed the lincoln to one and all
1 i am seing a lot of them out on the roads these days
2 very satisfied with overall purchase
1 overall the lincoln mkx is a true american luxury car that looks more expensive then it is
1 highly recommend the mkx to anyone looking for a true luxury car with out the luxury price
2 very classy appearance and a smoother ride than the murano i owned prior to purchasing this vehicle
2 the sync system has a big problem with siri on the iphone
1 when i use siri the whole sync system has to reboot
1 i hope they fix that issue soon
1 probably the best on the market today
1 again it is a lincoln
1 it is an american company
1 i have test driven every hybrid including the new lexus es and mkz wins hand down for comfort ride styling and mpg
1 the mpg is spot on
1 i'm averaging 42 combined
1 there is no hesitation when in ev mode at
1 last ditched attempt at a failing car company
1 truly your fathers luxury vehicle
1 beautiful car from design to execution
1 the paint is a mile deep ingot silver and the leather on the seats is buttery soft
1 the handling is excellent and the power from the 20 ecoboast is more than enough for any situation
2 i have sold lincoln's for 21 years and owned a 2001 before i leased my 2013 mkz
2 this car is by far the best in quality i have seen come from lincoln
2 the 2011 was a great car and rated best in dependability and i think this car is head and shoulders abo
2 this car is drawing attentiona great indicator for future of the !
2 i have had all ages complement style of the new mkz from the high school kids to heir grand parents
2 she loves it but she traded in a 2011 lincoln mkz that she loved
1 the overall concept of the design from head to toe was risky but well worth the return
1 starting with the powertrain v6 pumping out 300 horses felt strong and agile
1 if you test drive the mkz after test driving other hybrids i think you'll agree
2 this is an extremely unique vehicle made by a car company willing to raise the bar
1 most review comparisons that include the lexus 350 mercedes benz 300+ avalon audi 6 bmw 5 series and especailly the 2015 cadillac cts don't include this car
1 ford deserves a lot of credit for bringing this car to market and then refining it and pricing it to be competitive
1 i hope that the significant improvements to the lincoln brand can resurrect it just as buick has done
2 overall i am extremely happy with my lincoln mkz
1 it is much nicer than the bmw cts audi or infinity
2 if you test drive it you will purchase the mkz
1 everyone thinks the car costs 15-20 grand more than it did
2 very pleased with everything about the car
2 it's a great auto i am happy i bought this mkz
2 overall: the best car i have ever owned
1 in my opinion the best hybrid on the market
1 hybridcars website give it the best environmental impacxt on the environment
2 the hybrid lincoln mkz is fun to drive has good pick up speed and my current gas mileage is 341 mpg
2 it has nearly 5000 miles on it since we purchased it new in august 2012
1 i still need to register it to online to get an automated assessment of its p
1 and very driver friendly
2 i'd buy this car again without hesitation
1 it's criminal that there aren't more cars out there like this
2 i paid zero premium between the hybrid version and the gas version of the mkz
1 cannot figure why anybody would choose to have the exact same car at the same price for less gas mileage
1 why isn't everybody driving a lincoln forcing the price down for all of us
2 it is more stylish that the town car has an excellent turning radius very responsive and offers a quiet and fun driving experience
2 one of the best cars i have ever owned 14 so far
2 best car we've ever owned
2 when we replace our other car it will be with another lincoln hybrid
2 great warrenty !
2 i've had the car now 4 months and pretty much like everything about it other than the trunk size
1 it does take some time to learn how to efficiently drive and get the most out of your mileage
2 i'm still increasing my mpg's but it's doing better than adve
2 would do it again
2 i'm quite happy we chose the american made luxury hybrid
2 the price diffrence probably won't be recovered in gas mileage over the gas model but we feel better about doing our small part in reducing emissions and being more efficient
1 this car is definitely worth putting your review !
1 price for the standard features is unmatched across the luxury market; comparing like vehicles
1 i've wanted a lincoln for some time
2 i found this one and finally decided to get one
2 it is doing what i want it to do *s*
2 i wanted it for longer road trips
2 the 40 plus mpg and smooth ride have made mytwo 4000 miles to the east worth the purchase
2 with a fillup indicating 750 miles to empty it's great to just avoid going to the gas station
1 a few tweaks could be done with regard to storage compartments gas mileage etc
1 ; however i have a 2012 and perhaps all those matters were addressed for 2013
1 previously owned a 2011 fusion which i loved but wanted
1 what ever the mpg on car in show room with few miles is likely the mpg it will agerage
2 over all not bad car hard to see to side and rear but getting used to using the mirrows and backup camera warning sinsor are a nusance
1 maybe replace it with the new
1 overall we not gone buy lincoln mkz until lincoln designers find a full electric engine 32 or greater for this carwe will keep the car for maximum of 15 years and during this period company will have lincoln dealership services and i have no idea you d
1 it is a great all around car for comfort and !
2 my experience owning these vehicles has been very rewarding
2 i would say the styling v-8 power comfort safety features along with reliability of the tc probably driven 500000 miles----has been beyound my expectations
1 i will truly miss the towncar
1 luxury quality and looks are great
2 i love my lincoln town car and this is number four
2 at 6'6' i have much room
2 but i have made some changes
2 i took the regular air filter out and put in a k&n permanent air filter
2 i also use premium gas because i get much better performance

2 with my 5 year old in the back seat i have a renewed enthusiasm for family outings
2 i bought the car a bit hastily after i fell in love with it and i have no regrets
1 i recently had a chance to drive a porsche 911 which although it had more power fe
2 i am still in awe of this machine
1 very forgiving suspension and great stability
2 always makes me smile and my hands sweat a little ;- fast and fun
1 for the price 93000 you can't beat it
1 experts are comparing this to cars well over twice the price
1 not sure why he wasted his time even putting up a review
1 your thinking mactehs mine - great minds think !
2 this is the most fun i ever had with a car
2 between my 2011 bentley and my maserati i always prefer to drive my maserati 100% recommend
2 love it would buy it again
1 if you want a cheap investment by it !
1 would recommend if price was more reasonable and build quality is improved
1 terrible horrible car glad they are out of business
1 far too many people find it affordable
1 find away to lower the price and change bmw looks and it will be a spot on car that every one will be lineing up to buy 
2 best ever will buy again
2 the best car ever it's often mistaken for a limo
1 want a great awd suv that looks great is powerful and gives you 30+ miles per ?
1 look no further my sister is buying one this weekend
2 after driving with me to maine she fell in love with it
1 a rav4 does not come close to this !
2 spend the extra and get the grand touring-it is well worth !
1 the cx-5 with the 25 really does drive like a sports car
1 2013 cx-5 will be less expensive but getting the 25 2014 is well worth the extra cost
1 i don't believe anything else changed between the 2013 and 2014 suvs
1 this is hands down the most affordable and fuel-efficcient suv/crossover that is available on the market
1 mazda is one of the top manufacturers in the biz today
1 in looking at this class of car i was interested in the fuel economy the capability of the engine and the zoom-zoom factor that one expects from mazda
1 this grand touring model with all its features was materially less expensive
2 bought new for a great deal drives like a car room of a mid-size suv inside looks great true 32 mpg freeway with automatic
1 better than the honda crv better than the toyota rav4 in every aspect
1 the 2014 is the same car with minor upgrades
1 i became interested in the cx5 after extensive internet surfing reading reviews and ultimately traveling over 150 miles to test drive one
1 i drove a 2014 cx5 touring front wheel drive model at a dealership in albuquerque nm
2 we wanted a vehicle with lots of room and good gas economy
2 this was a wonderful choice
2 never have been a big fan of suv's but this one turned me
2 a great little suv for the couple on the go or the small family
1 lots of bells and whistles nothing outstanding
2 we just bought this suv a couple of weeks ago and so far it's been absolutely wonderful
1 we looked at many compact suvs and the cx5 seemed to be the best option
1 ford escape - too expensive rav 4 - ugly exterior honda crv - poor driving experience vol
2 not so pleased with this vehicle
2 i should have kept my prius
2 my fiance' fights with me over who's car this is i love the pushbutton start and keyless entry we got the sport awd version and so far are satified with it's performance on-road and in severe winter conditions
2 we purchased in sept of 2012 review i
1 i think driving should be fun but i need a practical vehicle that can hold some cargo
1 the mazda cx-5 fills the bill for the most part except it could use at least 20 more hp
1 nice looking suv with good gas mileage but they should improve the back seat access by moving back the wheel wells to allow adults to get in and out better
2 i am very pleased over all a pretty vehicle very sporty looking
1 great driving car with the best looks in any suv i have seen
2 looks good just standing still and drives like a dream
2 i am 70 years old and this is the best suv or car i have !
2 you can't help but love to drive it
1 perfect for what we need
2 not too big not too small and totally fun to drive
1 with the new 25 liter engine this vehicle feels alive agile and downright sporty
1 the car has issues behind
1 if mazda can solve it it is ok because bugs/flaws are reasonable for a first year model
1 but if mazda could not solve it or does not have the right attitude to solve issues it becomes a real problem
2 great car test drive it and you will be sold
2 i own another mazda that i have had for over twenty years without any major repairs
1 they do make fun reliable cars
2 i actually purchased the vehicle in march of 2012 but that choice wasn't available for this review
1 i like the fact that you don't see a lot of these on the road
1 glad i waited for 2014 25 engine
1 big upgrade over the crv this year
1 a very impressive small suv
1 great value and very !
1 great gas mileage
1 this jury is on the same page excellent product for the money
1 will it be okay in the western ?
1 i highly recommend this small cuv
2 my daughter likes mine so much she bought one for herself
1 i have been averaging just under 30 mph in mixed driving
1 attractive exterior design very good grip and steering
2 i find the driver seat uncomfortable- for a short person like me
2 i used to be a honda person but since i bought my 2008 maz
1 an outstanding new addition to the suv market
2 i really enjoy my 2014 mazda cx5
1 the suv handles very well
1 it drives like a race car making sharp turns easy and effortless
2 i like the blind spot monitor the tire gauge monitor
1 going to get my 2014 sky blue in two weeks time can't wait
1 quieter and better handling than others i drove
1 the perfect match for economy and power
2 traded in a '11 ford escape limited awd for the '14 mazda cx-5 gt in sep 2013 so this is after 4 mo of use
1 pickup is good comparable to the v6in the escape
1 mileage is better though not as good as some on here indicate
2 happy with vehicle overall
2 it's the most impressed i've been with a new car in 12 years of buying them
1 by far the most fun to drive and best looking cuv in its class test drove 8 others
2 the gt trim is well worth it and comfortable if you enjoy a sporty drive stiff springs
1 unlike some of its competitors the advertised highway mileage is achievable a
1 drive it and you will buy it
2 i ordered it a couple of days after test driving it's definitely the vehicle i want to be in for the next few years and the most fun suv i've ever driven
2 i would buy another one if i had to or recommend it to another potential buyer
2 shortly after we purchased our cx-5 i shared our positive experience with a colleague who was looking at comparable vehicles
1 they too had not initially considered the cx-5 but once they did they were sold
1 it too has become their vehicle of choice
1 close to a perfect small suv
2 suspension is the weakest part of an overall excellent automobile
2 outside of an mgb driven eons ago this is my first foreigncar and must say i am delighted with japanese technology and styling
1 the bells and whistles on this vehicle are superb and you won't be disappointed
2 would recommend and purchase this car again
1 buy one you won't be !
1 this car is definitely worth the !
2 so far we made the right choice but this coming winter will tell the whole story living in wisconsin's snow country
1 my search for the right vehicle was long
1 i have a 16 year old that is 6'3and 250
2 i look forward to going places in my terrific little car
1 it's little but has tons of zoom-zoom
2 and yes i bought the license plate !
2 great carbetter than the honda crv  i had
1 if you want a 5-passenger suv that offers great looks playful driving manners impressive technology and good value the 2014 mazda cx-5 deserves a test-drive
1 that it boasts class-leading fuel economy of up to 35 mpg feels like icing on an already tast
1 great car great on gas more fun to drive than any other suv i have ever driven
2 overall i do love this suv but starting to think something is wrong with the one i bought
1 if your going for the gt pay the extra for the tech package
2 our favorite vehicle in the past 20 !
2 you get your monies worth and then some
2 i have recommended the cx5 to my friend and family
1 if you are looking for a small to mid-size cuv then this is the vehicle for you
2 mpg is exceptional with the 25 engine my cx-5 averages 30 city and 36 hway
1 i am buying this car
2 overall very pleased with this purchase
2 we own our cars for a long time so researched carefully and believe this one will still be there ten years out
2 this is my first crossover and i love it
2 will definitely be buying another mazda when i need another car
2 still love the car after 3 months  have no problem so far with 3000 miles can't wait to drive on long trips and the price is great it's on clearance now so take advantage of it while you can 
2 owned less then 30 days taken one trip of 1000 miles loved it nice ride and low road noise
1 excellent vehicle for the cost concious
1 worthy of a test drive first before you comparison shop
1 overall typical great mazda quality
2 great vehicle got it at end of year deal for around 30700 before ttl etc 2012can't beat that for a grand touring package with bose option upgrade + moonroofgreat gas mileage as compared with other vehicles of this sizeabout 19-20 mpg on mixed 50
1 great design and have no maintenance issues !
1 final assessment: we did a lot of research between this vehicle and the gmc and chevy equivalents and based our purchase on the reviews that consumer reports gave this car
2 would not say i am unhappy with the car or regret buying it
2 its nice to approach the cx-9 press door button enter and start without removing keys from pocket
2 also enjoy feature to key press 2x and hold and have the front windows and sunroof open to get rid of that hot blast of air
2 i would buy another one if the 4 items i mentioned are addressed changed/added
1 i was wondering why mazda doesn't ask its owners for feedback on how they like the vehicle
1 the ideas can be incorporated into next year's design
2 gas milage is good for its size i rate it a 10 all around
2 this is my second cx9
1 first one was a 2008 which was bullet proof
1 this one is even better
2 very pleased have had it about a month

1 i did a lot of research online in regards to price including the competition and i found out quickly that mazda's don't carry a lot of mark-ups and !
2 having owned this car for about 3 months now and 3500 miles i could not be happier with it
1 i feel that mazda has but its best foot forward on this car
1 i did not drive the mazda 3 with the less horsepower so i can only say that the 184 hp is more than

2 great handling car  back seat & wind noise were my main problemsalesman were awesome & not pushy
2 2014 mazda3 is best summed up as a game changer
1 it has come back and it is on a mission
1 from the smiling grill to the new design language of the mazda brand has definitely turned the 3 into a smooth and attractive option
2 overall i enjoy driving it eventhough it's not that great driving on long trips
2 you need to go to rest stops every 25 hours just to stretch your legs
2 mileage is better than expexted i'm happy about that
1 displays are clearly marked and simple not l
2 i traded in a recent forester subaru again very sensible and plain yet the m5 is extremely fun and a great value for the dollar
1 one web site review satated this is the most outrageously fun vehicle to drive
2 mazda 5 has so many user-friendly features overlooked by many but build in as part of the overall concept of versatility and exceptional value
1 there are not many ways to shape a mini-van box  but i feel the m5 is stylish aerodynamic and i like it
1 the mazda6 is an awesome attractively priced mid-sized car for people who like to drive
1 styling is jag-like interior is almost germanic in functionality and the new skyactiv engine and drivetrain has been delivering 28 mpg in the city consistently
2 anyone who is in the market for a new sedan with a quality feel great looks class leading fuel economy and sporty handling should drive this car
1 2014 mazda 6 really stands out amongst its peers
1 with new designs of the fusion altima and accord the mazda had to bring something out to attract car buyers
1 exterior and interior on the 6 is definitely sharp and it will get your neighbors attention
2 in my one week of ownership over all i am pleased with the car intended functionsits fun to drive and it makes my driveway look sexier than ever beforei thoroughly checked out all the competition nissan honda toyota and this car was the only c
1 loads of tech available if you want it plenty of standard features for the more value minded
1 mazda has a winner with this one
1 from a single test drive this has jumped almost to the top of my short list of cars to potentially replace my 13 year old acura tl
1 after test-driving the competition from toyota honda nissan ford and kia this is hands down the best midsize sedan on the market right now
2 i come from driving toyotas all my life but have become a mazda believer
2 i test drove many cars before deciding to purchase this vehicle
1 mpg great styling comfort features and fun to drive all at a reasonable cost were the priority features i was searching for
1 my initial short list was civic accord mazda3 and 6 and the cx-5
1 i dropped civic and 3 w/out even looking thinking why go small when small family is ?
1 so we're down to three cars
1 dropped accord because well they're somewha
1 i really wanted to love this car
1 i wanted to get one as soon as i saw the new design
1 i knew i'd have to give up a v6 but must say the 4 cyl took off quite well
1 drive was great but really felt claustrophobic in the thing
2 moving up from a 2010 mazda6 gt plus this vehicle is better equipped
2 with a little over 300 miles i have averaged nearly 30 mpg with mixed driving
2 i'm still rolling on the new car tank of gas
2 the ride is much more quiet than my 2010
2 near perfection for someone desiring a fun to drive safe roomy and fuel efficient mid-size sedan
1 darn right especially with a !
2 i've owned this car for six months now and already have 10000 miles on it
1 it's just about perfect for a family sedan
1 you name it we test drove it - the combination of exterior and interior styling size handling and feature content are hard to beat
1 iihs top safetypick zoom-zoom great mpg great looksi guess it is the full package
1 i really think it is an excellent value for the $$
2 i purchased the vehicle through true car best choice i could have made i saved over $2500 of msrp
1 i had the car delivered to me being the b
2 car and driver name it the best car in its class over the honda accord ex and from my experince i agree
1 do a google
2 great car- you get a lot for your money
1 lots of technology options for your money and overall a great looking car- that looks drives and feels like a much more expensive unit
1 easily in the top tier of all current mid sized vehicles
1 the only cars that i drove and liked more were the hyundai sonata and honda accord
1 one of the best new cars on the market
2 i use to buy mazda's all the time in the 80 and 90 but left when mazda teamed up with ford but i am back now
1 every detail in the car  starting from the engine  i-loop technology and the sensors to the styling inside and out is very well thought of  and you could easily feel that
2 i would any day prefer a car which is comfortable to drive with all the featur
2 should cost over $10000 more but do not tell mazda
2 so good i cannot believe i do not see more on the rode
2 this is the best car i've ever had and i've had two bmws
2 i've had it for a month and driven it 1150 miles on both highways and nyc streets
1 it handles both surfaces equally well
2 i have the gt in soul red so it looks great and is fully loaded
1 was getting 32 mpg on the highway and now we're getting 32 mpg with the k&n in town
2 compared to camry accord altima all of which i have driven this is a driver's car that is tight and fun to drive unlike the others
1 handling is crisp and tight
1 steering has a bit more assist than needed compared to previous mazda 6 models but still
2 a lot of people come up to us and ask question on the car
2 i also love the gas mileages that i get
1 it's wonderful a lot of people love the color and style 
1 i was in the market for a family car
1 must have driven the dealers mad in my community
1 it came down to this and honda accord
1 i am sad to say i went with honda as this is definitely better looking but the cons became the deal breaker
1 i am in the market for a car and this definitely is in top 3
1 understated luxury that is classy
2 just with a few tweaks and it is a no brainer
2 the 2014 mazda 6 is the working man's exotic sports !
1 its voluptuous curves cavernous interior and above grade fit and finish lets it stand out in a crowded field of full size sedans
1 the competition from the ford fusion honda accord toyota cam
1 it rides better than the accord/altima with junky cvt
2 automatic trans works very well
1 one of my top 5 picks to buy
2 mazda is has created a vehicle that provides best in market value along with a vehicle that is fun to drive
1 excellent car for the money good quality feels solid
1 did i say the gas mileage is ?
2 i am 100% satisfied
2 very simply amazing getting 325 mpg mostly around town wish it had a tad more zoom but understand that's a trade off for the 325 mpg
1 anybody looking for a mid-sized car would be making a big mistake by not looking at this car
1 it is simply far and away above the camry accord sonata optima altima and fusion
2 i chose the mazda 6 over the nissan altima and subaru legacy because it had and style and the features i liked best
1 it's a great car and i'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new car
1 an excellent looking and fun to drive sedan
1 mazda's redesign of the 6 is simply stunning and the value delivered both in fuel economy and in safety features is really compelling
1 my reommendation is to test drive it
1 once you do you will end up buying it
2 the only fault i can find in the 2014 mazda 6 is that it is taking me a little time to adjust to the difference in power after owning a 2011 grand touring with the v6
1 the 25 gas is more than sufficient for any type of driving unless you are like me and
2 i compared with camry accord and altima and decided to go with 6
2 i'm happy i made that decision
1 the 2014 mazda 6 is the clear choice for those looking for an overall nice vehicle which is fun to drive
1 it has many technological advances with luxury sedan safety features
1 young or old you'll love the new mazda 6
1 best new mazda in !
1 do your self a favor and at least test drive the mazda 6 before you decide to buy any other car
2 after several weeks of researching my next purchase it came down to the mazda 6 and the honda accord sport but in the end i ended up buying the mazda
1 for starters it costs less and it gives really good gas mileage for a midsize sedan
2 very affordable reliable economical and overall value for price paid
1 thanks to mazda for offering fun to drive solid handling cars with tons of value
2 i've owned 4 mazdas and each one just gets better and better
1 if i just wanted a dd it still would not be the speed3 and as far as performance its useless
2 with the tech package you get everything you can wish for in a car for under $30k
1 according to experts out there this car is a race car so not for the beginner
2 lots of power but will remain calm and composed if driven as such
2 lots of fun to drive and commands respect on the road
2 i do recommend getting this if you want something cheap and quick its a great car to have as your 2nd car
2 its a solid car and really enjoyable to drive
1 this car punches way out of it's price range and should not be sold or loaned to anyone under 25 with out close adult supervision
2 great little hot hatch if you want performance for the money i would highly recommend this car and if you can swing it get one with the tech packagei love !

2 good truck good value good choice for us 2 old retired people glad we got it
1 my father had a trucking company many years and he always had dodge trucks for cargo vans pickups and box trucks found them to be dependable sturdy and long lifespans
1 this is an excellant small truck
1 the 47l gets good mpg on the hiway if you use speed control
2 as vehicles go this truck is probably my favorite
1 it has good exceleration but nothing spectacular
2 the gas mileage is good and it feels comfortable around town or on the highway
1 wind does not seem to affect it greatly
1 it is great for commuting or us
1 bear in mind that the later production big horns were trucks intended for commercial use fleets and so
1 so they are very basic; no luxuries at all and that's why they are cheaper than the average tacoma
1 but for the money they are excellent value
2 great truck i look forward to may trips with the family pulling our travel trailer with this beast

1 it isn't exactly fair to compare this vehicle with ice or hybrid vehicles
1 it is in a class by itself
2 it must be experienced to understand completely how it changes the paradigms
1 even then we are so ingrained in the way we think about interacting with
2 this car is a game changer- you must get in one to appreciate how much better a car it is than all of the other cars on the road today
1 in the future all cars will be like this
1 there is obviously a reason why consumer reports gave it the highest rating
1 i truly believe this car has taken things to another level and will go down in history with elon musk alongside as one of the most influential innovations/innovators of our time
1 think about it

1 general electric ge makes solar carports that can charge 6 electric cars simultaneo
1 the future is here
2 the car gets better over time as more features are added via software release
1 i want i want one i want one i want oh santa please bring me one
2 this car has to be driven to realize how game changing it truly is
1 before my test drive another person showed up in a $150k car and even he was wowed by the performance
1 for local use this would be a great car
1 tesla can do a better job of sharing addit
1 we agree this car is destined to become a classic; it's truly groundbreaking yet achingly simple and precise in concept design and implementation
1 this is what american ingenuity is about
1 see pros and cons
1 this car may not be foreveryone but neither is a 911 corvette or panamera
1 as for range anxiety 95% plus of people dont drive a 100 miles in a day and rarely does anyone take their porsche 911 or corvette on a family trip of greater than 300 miles
2 until you drive one of these you have no idea what an electric car designed from the ground up can be
2 best car i've ever !

1 test drove it
1 i wouldnt buy it
1 not unless it was at least half of the advertised price
1 there is more bang for your buck luxury wise spening your 60k+ on a another brand and a gas motor with good milage
2 what a pleasure to drive past gas stations and help the environment too
2 oh it's also so fast and responsive so that driving is fun again
2 my other car is a 2006 prius which in comparison is real basic transportation
1 this car is a masterpiece; a treat to drive and a dream to own i'm sure
1 i'm trying to convince my fiance that this should be our next car
1 the car is away over-priced !
1 how can an average family or person afford ?
1 bring the price down
1 sell morelots !
1 it's an amazing piece of machinery
2 i'd like to be able to plug it into an electricity source that doesn't use fossil fuel
1 i think tesla should partner up with a hydrogen fuel cell complany to produce the electricity needed to charge the battery
1 as much as i like the model s i am more looking forward to the model x with its slightly higher field of view and the seating capacity for my whole family and cargo
1 i think this is a good car but it might need a new generation
1 very pour for so expensive car

1 worth taking car of
2 no sloppy turbo with lag and the constant replace it every 50000 mile problem
1 great looking car at a not so great price when you should have recieved the ultimate machine from subarujust like mitsu and thier eclipse both companies missed the mark of what we want as tuners/sport car driversimho
1 with couple of options the price reach 30k
1 many options available at 30-35k such as sti evo nissan z
1 for 25-28 k i rather go for rallliart wrx base nissan z
2 would buy this car again
1 excellent vehicle for someone who appreciates driving
2 i am not trying to knock the brz not by any stretch
1 i sell cars and i get to drive an exorbitant amount of vehicles in a month's time
1 the brz just did not wow me at all the way i was hoping it would and i was disappointed
2 i would by this car again in a heart beat fantasic car
1 got out with a mile-wide smile

1 yet to see another on the road in denver 
2 overall recommended for a sporty fun car to afford one many smiles that is affordable
2 not a speed demon but find the curves and corners and you can imagine yourself in a very high end car driving experience very easlily
1 great platformhoweveri am going to wait for the sti version or the 2014 wrx or when a 4x4 version becomes available
1 still a very fun car to drive which turns alot of heads
1 looks more expensive than it is
1 diappointing price for a car lke that
1 good value for the money but a gti or mazda might have a bit more pep
1 i love the design perhaps in a year or two they will enhance the engine
1 if you just want a toy to play around with and don't live in the snow belt this is a good car to play with
1 there is no way i would drive this car in winter weather which makes this car  unusable almost 5 months out of the year
1 i was crazy for buy
1 subaru hit it out of the ballpark with the all new 2014 !
1 looking to be motor trend suv of the year for 2014
2 i got out of my 2012 forester lease early to buy this vehicle and it's my 3rd forester
2 i traded up from a 2010 and don't regret it
1 i feel the subaru delivers on the things i need: safety visibility and utility including handling rough roads; my complaints are about the more subtle details of the vehicle
2 our first subaru
2 test drove all the competition and the subaru blew them all away
1 great car and much more for your money than rav crvoutlander or equinox the others we considered
2 the electronic power steering took a couple days to get used to but now i love it
1 to top it off subaru also offers free break pads and wiper blade rep
1 i hope that subaru corrects this in the near future
2 i purchased by costco auto program
1 they directed me to grand subaru bensenville il 32i limited andi got awesome price for all models
1 was prepared to buy but i think subaru took a step backward on seat comfort and steering feel
1 test drove the mazda cx5 first and compared to that model the subaru lags in handling and road feel
1 well built solid feel and very comfortable
1 aside from the defrost issue it's an excellent value
2 the basic interiors such as small glove box and door pockets could be improved
1 we also think the forestershould be made here in the us like the outback
2 we almost bought an outback and are sorry we didn't sinceit's more roomy and a better value for th
2 love the subarus and this is my 3rd one
1 but hate that speedometer
1 the turbo version drives very smoothly and quietly with only a touch of hesitation
2 the outstanding bad spot is a big side pillar making left shoulder checks cumbersome and therefore dangerous
1 appearance is a wash - the 2014 looks bloated with an aggre
2 bot 25i premium i was surprised at the acceleration with cvt rear camera is good but screen could have been a little biggerride is very good and controlled
1 the view around the vehicle is good  no blind spots
1 sunroof is huge
1 legroom front and rear
2 overally i would choose this vehicle again
1 i was deciding between the rav 4 crv and forester
2 the forester provides the best bang for your buck
1 the rav 4 and crv in front wheel drive costed more than the all wheel drive forester
1 great vehicle for a family - for single guy driving in city not so sure
1 i really wanted to like this vehicle besides it's unnecessarily conservative looks
1 but how can you buy and drive a vehicle with substandard ?
2 lacking in cushioning thigh support and side bolsters to hold you in place while turning ?
1 well put together
1 the total package
2 great vehicle  wish the extra's  hitch  cargo cover etc
2 only time will tell if i become a subaru groupei
1 if subaru fix the seats and the steering it will be good for the price
1 hope they have fixed the head gasket and oil consumption issues with this new design
1 i think the forester is a great vehicle
1 i just can't buy one at this time as i would feel a little embarrassed driving it
1 the look is so dated they could do so much more
1 inside is roomy but they made front seats smaller annoying
1 who doesn't offer
1 there is no other manufacturer that can deliver a unbeatable awd system and almost 9 of ground clearance for $20000
2 i researched like crazy before buying itand am very !
1 the msn website has minimal information to work with and much what is here is wrong
1 you have drive the forester to appreciate it
1 it is a far better buy than the outback because the outback is selling too well for dealers to price it more fairly
1 i looked at 3 other competitors which i had researched & all would have been excellent choices
2 i settled on the subaru because i felt it provided the most features for the price & was the top choice of consumer reports for quality & safety review id:
1 run don't walk to get !
1 i owned two rav4's prior to this 2014 forester
1 they were both garbage in comparisonthis forester is the best thing under $30000i tested the rav4 escape crv and reviewed the others they were pathetic in comparisoncheck out some of the comparison v
2 owned many cars and suv's this could be the most fun suv i've driven
2 this lived up to our expectations
1 it won suv of the year in a car !
1 overrated will not let you state your opinion 
1 this vehicle is hard to beat for it's price
1 this is another reason why subaru sales are soaring
2 must have to go up to the snow
1 a great little car that feels bigger than it is excellent fuel economy and handling
2 here in the midwest the awd comes in real handy snow rain freezing rain you never know what you'll get i ski bike and kayak the roof racks and storage are great
2 i use it as a city car in nyc and it fits that role perfectly
2 it handles great takes potholes like a champ
2 the visibility while driving is perfect and i feel like i can see everything that is going on aroun
2 a great car if you want a car that feels big and still gives you mpg and awd at a great price
2 overall this is a wonderful car for me as i drive it back and forth to work daily
2 i save on fuel costs with the fuel efficiency it offers and i don't have to worry about the weather conditions with the all-wheel drive
1 so it is safe and economical
1 great deal all around i looked at vw tdi wagons and their premium price tag was not worth the extra 2 mpg's
1 excellent car although acceleration is slow handling and breaking is very good
1 i get about 32 mpg combined which is excellent for an awd car
1 the car looks good and is very simple which is good for reliability
1 it will get you where you need to go in
1 i wanted a compact wagon or hatchback with all wheel drive
1 not too many of those from which to choose but the impreza suits my needs perfectly
2 i can park it easily in the city i get the advertised 36 mpg on the highway where i spend much of my time
1 im used to high perfomance 200+ hp but this is the first time ive actually been impressed with the impreza
2 its great all around because with the awd you dont feel the lag from fwd cars when you accelerate
1 people now days mostly need to sprint to 40mph
2 if it's not for the oil consumption i love this car
2 most fuel efficient and economical all wheel drivevehicle out there for a best buy !
1 now i hear the xvcrosstrek will be produced as a hybrid in 2014 which will make leaps and bounds for the subaru name as being a fuel efficient economical automobile
2 does great in the snow
2 very pleased with this car
1 i have yet to buy a new car with good tires
1 there are far better tires that cost less than the stockones that came with this car
1 road noise level much reduced with tire change out
2 handling also improved and snow traction
2 the awd and safety features gives a very secure feeling when driving
2 excellent gas milage considering it has all wheel drive
1 i average around 30 mpg in the city
1 i had this car for couple days when my 09 impreza sedan was in for service
2 at first i was not impressed with the car even though the interior was a good improvement over the previous generation subarus
1 i'm not a fan of hatchbacks but after driving it
2 with plenty of hp awd brembo brakes and tuned sport suspension it's a real performer
1 great fun and you can drive it in the wintersti and snow tires is there anything more ?
2 seriously consider this car for the 25-30k rangegreat feel easy to drive great performance when you need it in awd
1 while not the perfect car its engine awd and suspension more than makes up for its deficiencies
2 its rally heritage can be felt and it gives the driver a raw and exciting feeling of a true drivers car
2 to get this feel usually requires paying much more
1 if you enjoy the driving experience while keeping practicality this is the car for you
1 the 265 turbo-charged 4cyl engine will push you back in your seat with virtually no turbo-lag but at normal driving speeds you'll get about 25 mpg
2 i think i will injoy this car for years to come
2 love this car can't ever imaging owning anything but a subaru
2 get this car cant beat the value for the price and the gas milage

2 the car has delivered on all expectations
1 i think it has the potential to become a new subaru flagship

1 this sporty crossover is a great find at this price point

2 we've only had the crosstrek for a few weeks and it is awesome

1 just a shame nobody knows more about this car
1 i always smile when it is the kizashi's turn to get me around

2 so far best suv i have !
1 real body on frame suv
1 solid truck built for off-road but regular driving feels like a chore
2 slow acceleration at low speeds picks up at higher speeds
2 turns have to be negotiated slowly unless you like that falling-of-the-seat sensation
1 this is the suv that i have been looking for the last 3 years
2 the explorer and jeep were incredible vehicles but i wanted a true truck to handle anything i can throw at it
2 great suv still body on frame so it will do what others would like to be able to do and still do it in style
1 trail edition if you are serious off roader sr5 if you are not looking to spend money and limited if you want it all

1 plenty of space plenty of options interior is a huge upgrade from last years model

1 2013 toyota avalon is a bold surprise from the toyota brand
1 this rendering of the avalon gets more style and sleek lines flowing through-out the design body
1 wheels can be fitted from 17's to 18's and that chrome grill gives the avalon some swagger
2 i don't know where you'd find a better car in the low $30k price range
1 i've tested & driven buick regal and lacrosse as well as cadillac ats really small for my 6'1 frame cts bmw & lexus
1 and for my money this car beats them all
1 it is a great looking vehicle and quiet
2 my next car will definitely be from a different company
1 the avalon is an unpretentious auto that has surprising performance characterisitics great quality relevant features
2 if i had to make a new car decision again i would still opt for the avalon
2 if you get the limited model make sure you take your smart phone in the car and play something via bluetooth on the stereo or bring in a cd that you know has a song with low bass sounds and test your stereo with some volume
2 i would definitely buy another
2 this is a super smooth comfortable fast luxury sedan without the luxury price tag
2 this is my third toyota and they have not disappointed me !
2 best automobile we have purchased in 30 years
1 it is not like the older models that are very sedate and buick-like 
1 the new body style and design are very nice

2 in our opinion this was by far the best value in it's class without breaking t
2 if they would fix the road noise issue and make the radio and speaker system as good as the gm and chrysler products they would have a winner

2 love our car
1 i think it's a great !
2 love how it handles the road
1 toyota did a great job with the redesign for their flagship
1 shares many parts wuth lexus so if you don't require the prestige nameplate avalon is a better choice
1 i rent and drove it for 5 days and 800 miles
2 it feels like a strong smooth and high quality car
1 as mentioned above they tried to add some fancy touch screen and a/c control
1 but they failed at this point in my opinion
2 a great car i love it and enjoy the driving experience
1 it seems priced right and i expect to see more on the raod
2 as of yet i have not seen another on the road
1 great job toyota for working hard on the all new redesigned avalon its just smaller for a large vehicle but saw few on the road and website its a beautiful car someone was in the market for a $40000-$50000 car i would talk them into buying a avalon
1 i love the looks of this vehicle
2 it corners excellently and practically drives its self
1 this car has everything that one could ask for in a vehicle
1 cross traffic warning blind spot warning dynamic radar cruise control loads of air bags great headlights extremely comfortable seats tons of room inside a large trunk for a hybrid
1 for the same $$ buy a !
1 the car is plain old fun to drive
2 we traded in our 2007 avalon limited for this updated model and simply love itthe v6 had way more get up and go than the hybrid duh and we liked that so we'll just pay gas for that 'feature'styling is a bit blah compared to other cars but we're ok
2 we love the car and actually purchased it over a lexus es 350 and mercedes e-350 which left our pocket book $20k + richerthe technology built into the car is overwhelming
2 the car comes with several well documented manuals for the owner
2 this is my second avalon
2 my experience with the 2013 would cause me to get another one
2 i had a 2008 love it !
1 go back to that ride
1 the 2013 toyota hybrid limited top of the line with all features avalon is very stylish has great acceleration and handles beautifully
2 this car gets lots of attention and honk
1 a wow vehicle fit for old turkeys like me and young cats looking for fun and one heck of a vehicle
1 it is basically the lexus es 300h without the $5k extra for the badge
1 a professional reviewer said that the lexus es looks like the box the avalon came in since he thought the avalon had better styling
1 a wow vehicle fit for old turkeys like me and young cats looking for fun and one heck of a vehicle
2 39-40 mpg will improve our economy 30% over 06 avalon and we were pleased with that as other cars than made 25
1 today other cars make 28-31 in this class
2 99 having owned and or driven every luxury car made in us over the last 40 years along wityh top of the line mercedes bmwand jagi consider this to be the finest auto made
1 i have owned autos that excelled in one or maybe two areas performance ride
1 toyota is on the right path now give us a venza !
1 this car is as much fun as either of those
1 but it uses regular gas is much quieter and its technology makes it safer

1 it is luxurious and well appointed
1 it has all the bells and whistles at a lower price and lower insurance than the luxury name cars
1 great for the environment
1 i really like that it is a hybrid

2 best vehicle i ever owned

2 i purchased one for my wife on a recent weekenc and liked it so much i went back and leased another for
2 highly recommend - beautiful ride
1 liked the prius love the avalon
1 not much difference in mpg
1 at 80mph i got 41mpg with the prius and 434 with the avalon

1 this car definitely meets those 2 criteria
2 i'm getting about 41 mpg about 50/50 split between highway and city
2 a quality touring sedan that's a pleasure to drive with outstanding gas mileage in hybrid trim
1 the gold-standard in where all manufacturers should be aiming in comfort handling room for a family and fuel economy
2 would do it again but maybe xle just for the seating but all the extras were not worth the $$ for us
2 always get 40 to 42 mpg as calculated by me and not the automatic system
1 i really like this car it fit my needs quite well
2 so far no rattles in 1 year usage 11000 miles
2 very comfortable driving
2 comfy comfy ride for passengers
1 averaging 40mpg around town and up and down hills
1 voice activation a !
2 before the camry i owned the 2008 prius and the take-off power with the camry is significantly better and feels equivalent to my v8 dodge ram truck
2 also the transition from engine to electric only is a lot smoother than the prius barely noticeable and

2 solid capable feel - feels like a tank that can do anything and go anywhere
2 can't wait to go camping in it
2 i bought the manual transmission and was kind of disappointed in the 12 mpg i got

2 you pay for the name lexus yes some of the features are a little plusher on the lexus but it isn't worth the cost

2 best of all cars i have owned and they number 14
2 great suv we did two long trips from texas to redwoods ca and to west virginia really a great one to own
2 my wife and i are in our seventies and purchased this vehicle more for its comfort safety features and stability on the highway than the all terrain features
2 we have owned three other toyotas in the past and never had any negative problems
2 i go everywhere in my cruiser
2 i have had 5 now and this is my first with the 57

2 overall i am very pleased with my toyota prius ii
2 despite some harsh criticism the prius has been an excellent reliable family car that has saved me time and money
2 the blue tooth is great and the basic audio system just fine for me
2 excellent car every home has to have one you will save a lot
2 i would never buy any other car but another prius i have had 20 brand new cars during my life from lincoln mark 7 to volkswages to 5 buicks and others will only but toyota from now on
2 great car and we get 60 miles to the gallon we are senior citizens and we enjoy the not having to spend money on gas
2 i have owned 3 new priuses and had very good fuel mileage with my 2010 and 2011 prius
2 my new 2013 prius does not do very good on fuel mileage especially on the road
2 i have close to 7000 miles on it and i think it should be doing much better
2 this is the most technologically advanced car i have ever owned and we plan on getting many years of clean economical driving out of it
2 for those with a 20 mile or less commute it is an outstanding choice
2 very good car that serves my needs really well
2 it's great for short ev mode and long trips hv mode it saves a lot of money on gas and it's just so fun to drive it on !
1 i would suggest to everybody to try out the prius it is real nice every week to go to the gas pump after 525 miles and only put in 9 gallons each !
1 learn how to drive this car
2 this is my 3rd one
2 2013 discount of $3000 off plus 0% saved me another $1700
2 total savings $4700 not counting gas savings
1 the vehicle list was just over 25000
2 downsized from a 15 mpg 2005 honda pilot to a 2013 prius ii that i bought for a very reasonable $20995 + tax
2 two rental car experiences at 48 mpg led me to the change
2 owned too many cars to mention but the prius is one of my favorites just under the
2 after having owned the cmax for 10 months and 15k miles i traded it in for this prius
2 my goal was to get a gas sipper that had a good safety rating
2 so i traded for the prius
2 and i'm glad i did
1 despite negative reviews for things like its aging looks
2 after 2 years and 60k miles - we made the best choice - saved so much $$$ - both prius' we own are fantastic not one repair or maint issue after all these miles - i expect to get 300000 miles on these cars
1 it says 2012 but our 3 cars are 2011 - did not
2 i am still smiling and enjoying the ride even knowing that i am driving to work
2 love the smart key and door touch locking
1 hybrid is the way to go just makes sense
2 so far all of our experience with this prius have been positive
2 just took a trip and it was smooth sailing gas mileage is in the high 40 s best i've ever had
1 my daughter told me to look at the prius
1 so i rented one for a weekend trip
2 i got 56 mpg at 65 mph for 200 miles & 53 mpg at 70 mph coming back
1 the car suprised me how well it drove & how nice it was
2 i bought one the next weekthis car is designed fo
2 the hatchback and rear seat fold down to produce a massive amount of storage capacity
2 the technology in the car is amazing
2 with a regular plug in it takes only 3 hours to rechar

1 ps i will try to keep updating my !
2 well worth the money if nothing else in the gas savings alone
1 i get over 50 miles per gallon on a regular basis
1 plus it is good for the environment
2 exactly what i was looking for better than i !
2 overall i am very pleased and am already planning for my next one
1 not good for my use
2 would/will buy again when this one is no longer driveable
2 i have owned toyota vehicles since 1997 and have always been satisfied
2 best and most efficient vehicle i have ever had
2 i love my new !
2 first car i have owned that del
2 what the manufactory promised and i have owned a lot of cars
2 the only regret is not buying 10 years ago
2 i have owned the prius package 2/ii 2005 2008 2011 and now the persona 2013 black cherry is awsome
2 the 2013 is by far a superior product although i miss my 2005 for other reasons
2 previous to owning a prius i owned a 199
2 i have owned my prius iii for just over 1000 miles which is hardly enough time to give an extensive review but enough to give a fair first impression
1 to be honest the prius is the only car i considered
1 i drive 65+ miles to work and back and really wa
1 outside of the great turning radius and the glitz of the instrumentation you cannot call this car fun to drive 
1 its trunk space appears to be limited maybe due to the battery/mechanicals underneath it's shallow
1 it's very slow to accelerate in econ
2 this is my second prius the first one i drove for 7 years with no problems
2 i bought the new one fully loaded and haven't regreted my decision for a moment
1 the leather seats have memory foam inside them
1 i would give this car a 10 and highly recomend this to anyone
2 it drives excellant it is a good car to own
2 i have owned a few small car and this is the best one of all  53 to 55 mpg to and from work 
1 from the store on one trip of 9 5 miles i got 71 mpg 
1 excellent car for driving in the city
2 twenty-five hundred kilometers on it so far and i am still over the moon
2 averaging 60 miles to the imperial gallon nimble in town and great legs on the highway
1 first the fuel economy
2 i purchased this vehicle with a very specific purpose in mind and it has been exactly what i needed it to be
2 i drive roughly 100 miles per day and make a 500+ mile trip once a month or solots of miles and it's usually just m
2 first new car and it was such a wise choice
1 better on gas safer more updated features
2 it may not be the sportiest or fastest car in town but it is fun to drive has great mileage and has extended service life
1 the car takes some getting used to because of its quirks hybrid based i think but once you know how to drive it
1 great car probably most economical option for a small car when figured with the hybrid fuel savings
2 wish they hadn't gone cheap with some of the stuff normally considered standard now
2 its some of the most bang for the buck you can get for a full hybrid vehicle that can do electric-only driving below 30-40 mph f
2 i would definitely buy another one
1 can't wait until the plug in model is available in michigan
1 i give it a 10 rating
2 it drives like a luxury vehicle - very smooth handling on the road
2 i bought this vehicle because i wanted a small wagon that got good gas mileage with ample cargo space to haul all of our stuff to our vacation home in the summer
1 the prius v accomplished both tasks
2 the car rides well and gets excellent gas mileage and the bells and whistles associated with the audio bluetooth and built-in gps are wonderful - easy to set-up and easy to use
2 bought one of the first prius v producedwas anxiously waiting for it
2 overall i love the vehicle and have recommended it to many people
2 it can be somewhat confusing to go between my wife's camry hybrid and the prius with the different gear shifts
2 this is a great car if you can get over the weak engine struggling when you need to accelerate for highway or city driving
2 owned for 2 weeks
1 it's surprising roomy on the inside
1 i've always driven suvs and it has that sort of spacing on the inside
1 i have a family of 5 with a son who is 6'2
2 he sat in the seat behind me i'm '6 and didn't complain at all
2 i like this car - have had it a little over a year without any problems
2 drove it from texas to virginia and back with 2 adults 1 child and 2 dogs and was comfortable and roomy
2 don't miss stopping for gas every 4 or 5 !
2 excellent car great mpg's lots of cargo room give it a 10 in spite of the flaws
2 i just recomimend it for someone who wants reliableble transportationi
2 i'm really happy with this vehicle would recommend it over all the similar station wagon type cars i looked at
2 driving a hybrid turned out to be easy love the gas savings too

2 my new xle rides smmoth seats are more comfortable and interior is upgraded
2 styling dash controls the power of the engine and the options are great well satisfied
2 overall its' a nice ride things can be changed or upgraded its' a first year model remake so they can work out the bugs
2 hopefully this will last me for a long time
1 i'm new to the toyota family so we'll see
1 good looking exterior
2 the right size for a small active family
2 very disappointed in toyota quality on this rav4
2 im not totally satisfied with this car
2 i had this as a rental while my 2012 escape was being looked at not fixed just looked at for the 3rd time i fell in love with it
1 i never even considered test driving a rav4
1 now im considering buying !
1 you can never be wrong choosing rav4
2 i never did want to get a crossover but my wife did and she deserves what she wants
1 of the 5 we test drove we were on agreement the rav4 was it
1 if you are in the market for a crossover for some reason put the 2013 on your compare list
2 very fun car to drive the 25l had more getup-n-go then i expected
2 also the dealer experience was very pleasant
2 drives and handles well nicely styled and sporty has great space and controls with good gas mileage
2 styling dash controls the power of the engine and the options are great well satisfied
1 might as well take the bus than buy this car waste of money
2 the new rav4 has improved in seating comfort and driving position but acceleration is just adequate with eco mode off and downright slow with it on

1 one interesting observation is that everyone that my wife and i have met who own rav4s have only positive things to say about them
2 based on what i've experienced in my newer 2013 model i am pleased with the vehicle but am waiting for the inevitable dee
1 the right car at the right price is usually hard to find
1 toyota has done an amazing job with the new rav4 and it can be loaded with all the bells and whistles that you want at a price that you can afford
1 perfect for me at age 64 for traveling  shopping flea markets and just enjoying !
1 the best small suv on the market

1 one drive is all it took
1 sporty looking but also very classy looking
2 i have the 2013 toyota rav4 limited
2 will never go back to a sedan !
2 the rav has a lot of pep and handles beautifully on !
1 if comparing to a honda crv see if the emergency brake foot pedal impedes your foot from resting completely on the dead pedal as it did for me
2 the rav4 eliminates the concern by offering a hand lever instead much better no reason to consider the hond
2 love the looks and handling
1 this is a fun vehicle to drive and the gas mileage is great

2 i'm in the process of getting some of the cons fixedi hope anyway
2 i purchased the tacoma double cab with trd off-road pkg for $430 below invoice
2 that said this truck is great even with the cons noted
1 i compared the nissan frontier with the tacoma when shopping for a smaller truck
2 i still bought the tacoma
2 yes preferred the nissan ride more
1 but preferred the tacoma in almost every other way
1 it is not a small truck it is clearly mid-sized

2 for me it has exceeded my expectations
1 compare carefully before you buy this vehicle
2 i test drove many cars cross-overs and suvs before i settled on my venza 10 months ago
2 given what i paid for it and the subsequent low cost to own this car insurance registration fuel costs etc
2 i am so glad i purchased it
2 i would do it all over
1 took a while checking out all the different styles of venza
1 went to a few different dealers to find all the different trims
1 had to compare the v4 to the v6
1 then the fwd to the awd
1 just liked the way it drove
1 if your looking for style comfort and something a little different than all the other sedans on the road check out the venza
2 for the price i paid and what i got for my money i could not be happier
2 my insurance is very reasonable
2 toyota's 24-month maintenance free program is great; something i never got from ford or gm
2 my lease is only 10 months old and i am looking to find another car to trade because it is so unsafe
2 the styling cavernous interior cargo with seats folding flat at the flip of a lever excellent gas mileage for it's size i4-awd and toyota reliability won me over in spite of this one major downsidei wish i could have gotten the sunroof !
2 i would definetly buy another
2 dealer service has been excellent; five star
2 i would definetly buy another

1 just think i was looking at a cheverlot equniox
1 glad they wanted an outrages price for it or i will have been in
2 i had a 2010 venza v-6 awd which i like very much

1 once you know the good and the not so good you will know if this is the car for you
1 the long and short of it is; do you live where a hardtop is really useful
1 i gave this car rating of 9's and 10's
1 perhaps that has to do with the convertible more than anything else
1 i narrowed my search down to the eos and the toyota solara convertible

2 the car is a joy to drive at any speed and with an average mpg of 34 mpg i am a very happy owner
1 volkswagen continues to create practical and inspiring gti hatch that fits like a glove and handles like an obedient puma 
1 in one artful elegant and wonderfully understated package
1 it's a super fun car to drive: sporty & quick but easy to get along with day-to-day
2 i bought a 2010 gti with 13000 mi
2 it is a great car for someone who wants a smaller practical hatchback that performs very well gets 32mpg on the highway and has an interior that embarrasses many $35-45000 cars
1 as the old adage goes: it's funner to drive a slow car fast than a fast car slowwhile the gti is no rocketship it is fairly quick
1 note in europe these are premium c
2 such a joy to drive without the hassle of always having to shift in traffic
2 i'm very happy with my gti
2 i have no complaints none at all
1 if you want a faster car or a car with top of the line interior then the gti is not for you and you my want to go and buy a luxury sport car
1 i guess some buyers just like to complain about wh
2 ive owned a 2010 manual and loved it the only problem in 30k miles was a faulty tire pressure sensor
1 i love the timeless plaid seats that hug you as accelorate through corners
2 i recently bought a 2013 4 door dsg so the fiance can drive it too and i
1 overall it is a great car that is fun and practical at the same time
2 there are compromises regarding quality vs cost and performance vs livability and practicality but this car gets most of them correct
1 jetta seats one more than mercedes cls550
1 i kind of don't want to let people in on the secret diesel society but it is amazing
1 i still get questions like doesn't diesel fuel cost ? 
1 obviously people who didn't pass 4th grade math
2 compared to my last vehicle which got 30 mpg the 5-10% e
2 fun ride it looks great
1 never been a volkswagen fan before but if they keep up the fresh designs and great performance i may stay one for life
1 i've test driven a dozen carschryslers toyotas hondas 
2 only thing that comes close was a well packaged
2 have had absolutely no problems at 10 months and 11000 miles
1 it is worthy for the price
1 i don't know why would you want to spend money on prius
2 go get it and you will love it
2 great combination of comfort handling economy and an awesome cross-country cruiser
1 it is ok but i advise you shop & compare before making a decision
1 i love driving a manual transmission and the great gas mileage
1 but there is nothing excessive or fancy about this car
2 its great fun transportation
2 haven't been this happy with a car for a long time
2 it is my first family car but it does not look like !
2 i really like my !
2 even though this is the cheapest vw one can buy i still think the quality of the build and materials should be better
2 if i had it to do all over again i would rather have spent more money and been happier
1 this is a very underwhelming vehicle
1 much better than a prius any day of the week
1 the best bang for the !
1 you get all the bells and whistles for the starting price of accords camrys etc
1 the best car in its segment at a low price
1 the best deal you can get
1 i'm afraid the performance of this vehicle will get me into trouble with law enforcement
2 im super happy with my 2013 jetta
2 it drives excellent i got a great deal on it and i look forward to driving it !
1 this is the ultimate driving machine regardless what other makes !
2 do not regret the purchase
2 highly recommend for low cost ownership and high reliability
2 very happy with purchase so far
2 glad i bought it and would do so again for sure
1 would just restate that you want the diesel and manual transmission to get the most out of it
2 i have the diesel: i average 425 mpg on highway driving without being slower the flow of traffice i average 43-48mpg
2 best vehicle i have ever !
2 buyer beware
2 a great car in town and on the road
2 the dogs love their own area to hang out in
1 if they ever allow the e-ron diesel engine to be sold in the usa will trade up to it the day it's available
2 i use the vehicle for route service
2 i always have 300lb or more of cargo plus my 250lb and still get 40mpg
2 i looked around a lot before purchasing and couldn't find anything even close to the storage/mpg of the diesel sportwagen
2 i have had it a year n
2 great car i would buy another one 
1 the sportwagen has the best of everything
2 this is my second jetta wagon
2 also owned three passat's as well
1 this is a wonderful wagon great size and performance
2 best vehicle i have ever !
1 though uglier and not as fun to drive i would recommend a prius v over this car
2 bought a 36 se with sunroof and navigation
2 drove both the se and sel models and decided i did not need the fancier seats and higher price of the sel
2 the only other difference is a few chrome trim pieces and the rear view camera that the sel gets
2 everything as good or better than !
2 not one complaint
2 got an excellent deal on itmy monthly fuel savings covers the car payment
1 the rear seat is super roomy and the trunk is huge
1 i test drove many cars
1 small 4cyl cars with similar mile
1 this is a continuation of the consportion above
1 i ran out of charater space in that box
1 this was 1 week ago
1 sedan you can buy
1 luxurious enough and german to compete with cars that are more expensive even the rich cousin the audi a4/a6
2 it's ok i suppose but i would not buy a vw again
1 if you commute or do a lot of highway drivingthe tdi is the vehicle for you
1 if you only drive around town and put very little miles on in a year then the tdi would be overkill stick with the gas model
1 the passat has many of the luxury sedan features space and comforts that we test drove for a fraction of the price
2 cons cont'd: the fuse has blown twice blew for the 2nd time when i plugged it in to test it at the dealers service center parking lot
2 working for the last day; so hoping it was faulty fuses vice a ground in the electrical systemoverall review: have h
2 the car more than meets my needs and exceeds my expectations regarding usability
2 as long a diesel prices stay steady and available atmore places this is the way to go
2 overall i'm really happy with the car
1 vw credit has a great lease option
1 when my 3-year lease on my dark silver passat se with pleather/moonroof/navigation is done i plan to buy a new or pre-owned '12 or later black tdi sel premium with the split-spoked alloy wheels
1 i've seen a handful on the road and that c
2 terrific vehicle for commuting & long 500+ mile per day trips
2 overall the passat tdi is a well made car that i wish was cheaper to offset the higher diesel pump price and the lack of a backup camera and usb port
2 the radio with xm was really nice and the room in the car cannot be !
1 on the road the car is resp
2 quiet the driving experience and vw will have a solid 10
2 overall i would recommend this car over a honda/nissan/toyota but maybe not over a gm/ford/chrysler
1 the ride quality is good and squarely aimed at the us market in its handling but not what an owner of a previous german sedan would expect
2 love my passat
2 after 4 hondas decided to try something different
2 went for the diesel model and after 7 months i have no complaints at all
1 averaging 40+mpg combined and thats not driving it conservatively at all
2 i miss the power at times but enjoy driving
1 i expected a higher reliability for this car
1 a real pleasure to drive
1 may be a good option for those who prioritize handling
2 i liked the car but concentrated on driving so i can't comment on the cars other qualities
2 i consider the routan to be a solid van
1 good looking van but not at all worth the money when you factor in the down time for repair
1 feels german even though it's not
1 plush ride and looks better than the competition
1 if you drive in the mountains or live at altitude you owe yourself a test drive
1 no other 4 cylinder ute that was non-turbo had the guts of the tiguan
2 the car has many great features and i got it for 4k under list which sealed the deal
2 should have purchased this car years ago
2 just the perfect size for me great driving position seats are very comfortable and adjustable height position on the center arm rest
2 i typically have buyers remorse and have not had it even the slightest since buying the car 6 months ago
2 paid a little more than i planned for this vehicle but it has all the bells and whistles which i love
2 a pleasure to drive in any conditions
2 i would buy again if they can fix the ticking in the doors
2 great buy very happy w my purchase
1 would have liked to have a diesel tdibut that is not available in canada
2 people have actually stopped me to admire it and ask about it
